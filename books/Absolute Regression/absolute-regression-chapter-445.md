# Absolute Regression Chapter 445 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Trong chương này, nhân vật chính (tôi) đối diện với hậu quả lời hứa trở thành tiên phong trong vòng năm năm. Cậu nhận ra viễn cảnh chiến tranh tàn khốc và những mất mát không thể tránh khỏi, đặc biệt là việc phải đối đầu và có thể giết chết những người quan trọng như Jin Ha-gun và Visain.

Khi cha cậu (Thiên Ma) hỏi về giấc mơ mới, cậu đùa rằng mình đã bị lừa vào một cái bẫy do các trưởng lão của Thiên Ma Giáo (Tongcheon Pavilion) giăng ra. Tướng quân Sima Ming xuất hiện, xác nhận rằng có một lý do khác cho cuộc triệu tập các Ma Nhân (Amazons) lần này. Sima Ming khen ngợi cậu đã trở về an toàn từ Bắc Hải, nhưng cũng chỉ ra rằng cậu đã tự trói mình vào một lời hứa khó khăn, gọi nó là "Murimiltong" (Võ Lâm Nhất Thống) và nhấn mạnh thời hạn năm năm như một cái bẫy tinh vi.

Sima Ming tiết lộ rằng ông đã điều tra nguồn tài trợ của những kẻ chủ mưu đứng sau các sự kiện gần đây và cần sự giúp đỡ của các Ma Nhân. Trước khi Sima Ming có thể yêu cầu, cậu đề nghị sẽ cùng cha mình giải quyết vấn đề này, gây bất ngờ cho mọi người. Cậu muốn có cơ hội để cha mình thay đổi ý định và cùng nhau trải nghiệm Trung Nguyên (Jungwon).

Sima Ming phản đối, viện dẫn quy tắc rằng Thiên Ma và các phó lãnh đạo không được di chuyển cùng nhau để tránh nguy cơ bị phục kích. Ông cảnh báo rằng nếu Thiên Ma di chuyển, võ lâm sẽ trở nên căng thẳng và bất ổn. Tuy nhiên, cậu thuyết phục rằng cha mình cần phải ra ngoài và thực hiện giấc mơ của mình cho thế giới.

Cuối cùng, Thiên Ma quyết định sẽ cân nhắc lại vấn đề này sau. Sau cuộc họp, các Ma Nhân bàn tán về tình hình. Chwi Ma (Chwima) cho rằng không thể thay đổi ý định của Thiên Ma trong vòng năm năm, còn Ma Bul (Mabul) tin rằng đây là một màn kịch do cậu dựng lên. Kwon Ma (Kwonma) ngầm ám chỉ rằng cuộc chiến giữa cậu và cha mình đã bắt đầu. Độc Vương (Poison King) tin rằng cậu sẽ thành công trong việc đưa cha mình ra ngoài.

Tại văn phòng của Sima Ming, cậu mang đồ ăn và thức uống đến để cảm ơn ông. Sima Ming tiết lộ rằng Thiên Ma đã quyết định sẽ đi cùng cậu. Ông nói rằng lý do ông phản đối ban đầu là vì muốn Thiên Ma thấy một góc nhìn khác. Sima Ming cũng nói thêm rằng ông sẽ lo liệu mọi việc ở nhà và không lo lắng về kẻ thù vì có Thiên Ma đi cùng. Trước khi rời đi, cậu hỏi Sima Ming về phong cảnh của riêng ông, và Sima Ming trả lời rằng ông yêu thích cảnh từ bàn làm việc của mình.

Chương kết thúc với việc cậu háo hức mong chờ chuyến đi cùng cha mình, trong khi Sima Ming đảm bảo rằng mọi việc sẽ được giữ bí mật.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-444/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-446/)445  

When I heard my father say that I was strong, I thought back to myself on the battlefield.




The countless fights that took place before the return, and the fights that took place after the return. Even if you add them all up, it’s just a fight, not a war.


Once the war begins, battles that turn an individual’s life into hell take place every day throughout the Central Plains.


The original cause, which was as red and thick as blood, gradually fades, and I die without even knowing why I have to fight.


What’s even more terrifying is that it doesn’t end easily. It could take months, years, or even decades. War is easy to start, but hard to end.


Is it really peace that is achieved through so many sacrifices? Or is it greater conflict, hurt, and revenge?


What if I faithfully fulfill my role as the vanguard of that war?


Jin Ha-gun, the Demon Destroyer, will die by my sword.


I can picture Jin Ha-ryeong wailing in front of his corpse. She will spit out curses at me and swing her sword to kill me. In the end, she will die by my hand.


Visain is no different. What can I say as I look down at him as he dies? Where should I throw away all the things I said to him?


Just imagining it makes my heart suffocate, the war of the whole martial arts world. Just imagining it like this alone tells me how I will have to live for the next five years.




‘Father, there will be no war. So I am very curious to know what your new dream will be.’


I was trying to react honestly, but I ended up behaving like I usually do.


I made a joke with a pretended look of pain.


“That’s too much! You planned this from the beginning with the devil to trap me, right? Elder Doma laid the groundwork, Master and Demon Buddha gently shook the bait, and today, Father snatched it away. Right? This was a plan set up by Tongcheon Pavilion, right?”


My father looked at the entrance to Cheonmajeon Hall at my prank.


“Ask the military directly.”


At that moment, General Sima Ming was entering Cheonma Hall.


The fact that he appeared here made it clear that there was another reason why Father had called all the demons together today.


Yeah, he’s not the kind of person who would call all of the Amazons together just because he wants to see his father.


After paying homage to his father, Sima Ming respectfully greeted the demon lords, who also paid homage to him by giving him a prize. Finally, Sima Ming greeted me.




“Little Master, I am glad you returned safely from the North Sea.”


“I’m late in greeting you. I was a bit busy because I fell into a trap prepared by our military leader.”


Even though it was a sudden remark, Sima Ming smiled instead. He guessed what I meant by that.


“The name of the trap I fell into was Murimiltong. I said I would become the leader with my own mouth without even knowing that I had fallen into the trap.”


Since he knew all too well that I had been meeting with the Amazons, he immediately guessed what kind of promise this was.


Sima Ming pointed out the core of this promise.


“Of course, you set a deadline for becoming the vanguard. How long did you set it for?”


“It’s been five years.”


“Isn’t the name of this trap Five Years? It looks to me like the leader is missing in it.”


He saw right through me that I had wasted five years. Just as my father had known and accepted my promise, he had already guessed what I was thinking.




Indeed, the moment his words ended, I saw a faint smile appear on my father’s lips. He was satisfied with the fact that Sima Ming was seeing the situation accurately.


Sima Ming also realized that there was a magic formula for a five-year period.


“I think it’s a trap that I wouldn’t have been able to avoid if it had been seven or ten years. Five years is an exquisite period that I can’t avoid.”


The demons would also have understood what Sima Ming was saying.


The sound of a horse’s advance was heard immediately.


– This was all your plan. I was worried that I had made an unreasonable promise without knowing that.


―It’s a tough promise. I have to work hard for the next five years. My brother has to help me too.


-Please don’t involve me in your business!


Meanwhile, Sima Ming explained to everyone why he had appeared here today.


“The reason I came to see you today is to report directly to you what I have investigated. After learning of the existence of the masterminds, I have been tracking them on my own. What I have focused on is their source of funding. It would take a huge amount of money to move such a high-ranking expert and organization, and as a result of my secret investigation, I have found a clue to track down the masterminds.”


The reason he came here was to convey this message and ask for the help of the Amazons.


“Considering the power of those guys we’ve seen so far, I think the Amazons should step forward and deal with them directly.”


Sima Ming must have already decided in his heart who to entrust this matter to.


I stepped forward before he could point out Amazon and ask for help.


“Before that, may I say something first?”


“Please do it.”


Sima Ming waited for an answer, but the person I wanted to talk to was my father.


“Father, I have something to ask you.”


“What is it?”


“Father and I will resolve this matter.”




Since they never thought I would say something like that, not only my father, but also Sima Ming and the demons were all surprised. They looked like they had misheard. No, Sima Ming was hoping that he had misheard.


“You and I will go out together. Just you and me.”


I have talked to my father about going to Jungwon many times, but I have never done it yet. This time, when the opportunity comes, I plan to spend time with my father.


“Five years will pass in no time, right?”


That’s what my father told me earlier. Given the nature of this promise, which required me to change my father’s mind, in order to be fair, I had to give him a chance.


The Amazons looked at him with curious faces, wondering what his father would say.


“Why don’t we go out together and finish it all quickly?”


Sima Ming stepped forward before his father could make a decision.


“That won’t do.”


Especially since he had never interfered in conversations with his father like this, I could tell that his words of refusal contained a firm will.


“Do you know what the young cult leader is asking you to do just now?”


He asked in a soft tone, but his eyes were very serious.


“I know.”


Sima Ming shook his head.


“No. It seems that the young sect leader doesn’t know. If he did, he wouldn’t be able to make such a request.”

“Why not?”


I could feel everyone getting nervous in the tense atmosphere. It had changed from a match between my father and me to a match between Sima Ming and me. The curtain hasn’t come down on today’s stage yet.


“It is a rule that the original leader and the sub-leaders do not move together unless there are special circumstances. They even eat different dishes.”


This is to prepare for an ambush or poisoning. If the two are together and die, the leader will be absent.


“Are you saying that you are worried that your father might be in danger? You are worrying about the wrong person. You should be worrying about the martial arts world, not your father.”


Then Sima Ming answered as if he had been waiting for it.


“That’s right. That’s exactly why. If the leader moves, this martial arts world will be in danger.”


This was exactly what Sima Ming was worried about.


“When the leader moves, this martial arts world becomes tense and rigid. The sense of crisis becomes extremely heightened, and small things can spread and become big things.”


I persuaded Sima Ming in a good tone.


“You can just go and come back secretly. Let’s pretend that Father is in the dormitory for a while.”


“If that is revealed, the martial arts world will be even more shocked.”


Cheonma’s journey to Gangho was a weighty one that required such great responsibility.


Sima Ming added some scary words.


“If things go wrong, the moment when the Young Leader has to take the lead may not be five years later, but five days later.”


I knew very well what Sima Ming was worried about.


“But that doesn’t mean that my father has to stay in Cheonmajeon his entire life.”


Even Sima Ming couldn’t refute that statement. He was the one who understood his father’s frustration better than anyone else in the school.


My gaze turned to my father.


“I respect the dream that my father has. However, since that dream is a dream for the world, I think he should go out into the world and dream it.”




My father looked at me without saying a word.


I said with my eyes.


Father, it is time for you to go out with me.


My father will know why I am doing this.


Since it was a conversation between my father and me, the Amazons did not step forward and each watched us with their own eyes.


Sima Ming said with a light sigh.


“I got the name of the trap wrong. It was excommunication, not five years.”


The joke was that he was the one who fell into the trap.


Finally, my father came out.


“Let’s discuss this matter again after we’ve thought it over. Then, let’s end our meeting here for today.”


Obviously, my father has already made a decision. But not saying anything here would be for the sake of saving face for the one who was not chosen.


After saying goodbye politely, I and the other demons left Cheonmajeon.


At the entrance, the blood clot machine spoke to me.


“You really don’t get tired.”


After making a five-year promise with his father, he was again making trouble by creating an issue of excommunication with Cheonma.


“Won’t five years go by so quickly? You have to move diligently while you have the chance.”


Then Chwima brought up the words he had been holding back.


“No matter how much I think about it, I don’t think I can change the leader’s mind in five years.”


On that point, Mabul’s thoughts seemed to be the same.


“Didn’t I say that today’s event was a stage created by the cult leader?”




His body began to glow with light again.


I looked at Kwonma. He didn’t say anything, but his eyes seemed to say this.


Didn’t the cult leader say he was at war with his son?


He will consider the war to have begun in earnest today.


Behind the large body of the demon king, the figure of the Poison King was visible. When all the demon lords here go to war, he will protect the Heavenly Demon Sect. The one my father dislikes but trusts the most.


Also, he was the first Amazon to figure out what I was thinking. When I was joking about being attacked, he was the one who sent me the message that it was my father who was attacked.


“This time, be sure to bring it. Don’t make excuses about the leader.”


He was already confident that I would be able to go out with my father.


The Subhon Majon standing next to him bowed his head to me respectfully. It was an expression of regret for changing his mind and choosing my father. I smiled and replied. You are my father’s Majon and my Majon.


Ilhwageomjeon gave a word of encouragement.


“I believe that if you are a cult leader, you will find a way.”


Regardless of my support for my father, I feel that those words are also sincere.


The evil Soma was looking up at the sky in silence. What could he be dreaming about now?


I sighed and lamented.


“I talked a lot and shouted loudly today, but it was really hard. As you know, who is my opponent? It’s my father. I have to change my father’s long-held wish. Would hitting the Heavenly Demon Sword with an iron sword leave a scratch? From now on, you all need to help me. Where is my father’s Ma-jon, my Ma-jon? Our Ma-jon. Now, since we’ve all gathered for a long time, let’s all have a drink… Huh? Where are you all going? Elder! Master! Brother!”


The demons were already scattering in the eight directions where their dwellings were.


“No, I’m having a hard time! Please console me and come up with a plan. You’re really going too far!”


Everyone disappeared without looking back.


However, from far away, the Bloodthirsty Horse sent a message.


-There’s someone else you should be drinking with right now, right?




\* \* \*


“Your Majesty.”


Sima Ming, who was working in his office, had a look on his face like he had expected me to come.


“It’s exactly the time you must be hungry. You work late, as expected.”


I bought some drinks and food from the Pungryu tavern just in time for dinner. I bought a lot to share with my soldiers.


“I still have work to do, so I will decline the alcohol. Instead, I will enjoy the food with my subordinates.”


Looking at the piled up work, the piled up work in Gowol’s room came to mind. The life of a soldier is truly arduous.


“You probably already know why I’m here. What should I do?”


Sima Ming was silent for a moment.


I understood Sima Ming. No, I was grateful. Because he was protecting my father like this.


“If you’re really worried, I’ll take the Amazons out.”


Then Sima Ming asked with a strange smile.


“What kind of Amazon?”


“First of all, I don’t want to stand out, and my father needs to be comfortable.”


The Dokwang and Seophon were eliminated from the list because their father needed to be comfortable.


I want to go with the evil Soma, but the white mask is too conspicuous. In that respect, it’s the same with Mabul.


He recently returned from a school exile with Chwima. Even if that wasn’t the case, if I had asked him to go with his father, he would have jumped into the lake in front of Chwimongru.


In fact, the person that my father would be most comfortable with is Kwon Ma, but his size and impression would attract attention wherever he goes. Even if he hides his face, how can he hide those big fists?


Just by wielding that large sword of destruction, Blood Heavenly Sword will draw attention from those around her. Even though Ilhwa Sword Master was decent, she is currently running towards the pinnacle of swordsmanship and will not wish to leave the school.


“… … There’s no one to go with. There are eight of us.”




Sima Ming smiled at me as if he knew what I was thinking.


“It’s all because our father is picky. He really works hard to help our father.”


“You don’t have to try so hard.”


Amazing facts coming out of his mouth.


“The leader has already made his decision. He will go out with the younger leader.”


“Did you speak to the soldier?”


“You haven’t done it yet.”


The reason I am still confident is probably because I have been with my father for a long time.


“I’ll probably get word in a few days, so please take note and get some rest in the meantime. You must have been so busy meeting the demons after returning from the North Sea that you haven’t been able to recover from the travel fatigue.”


“Thank you, sir.”


If Father moves, everything will be kept secret. Whether he goes out or comes back.


“Are you happy to go out with the leader?”


“My heart is already pounding.”


“I may have opposed it to the end, but do you know why I changed my mind?”


“What is it?”


“I liked that. It was about showing the leader a different view.”


How could he not feel sorry for his father who was trapped under the name Cheonma? That must have moved his heart.


“Please enjoy the scenery with your cult leader. I will take good care of the house.”


He had no worries at all about the forces behind the scenes that he would have to deal with. After all, if his father was going out himself, why would he worry about enemies?


“Thank you, sir, for helping me out without being so reckless. Thank you so much.”


As I was about to turn around and leave, I suddenly asked him a question.


“Then what about the scenery, sir?”


Although I asked out of the blue, he immediately understood the meaning of my question.


“I love the view from my desk, so don’t worry about me.”


After responding to his devoted heart with clear and deep eyes, I left his office.


When he wants to find his own landscape someday, I hope it won’t be too late.
