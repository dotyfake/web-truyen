# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 182 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Trong chương này, các lãnh đạo của Liên minh Murim (Murim Alliance) tụ họp để bàn về việc Ma Gwang-ik-ju tham gia vào Gaepa War (Gaepa War). Jegal Hyeon thuật lại lời của Geomseong (Sword Saint), rằng ông ta đã "phải lòng" Ma Gwang-ik-ju. Murong Gajuda báo cáo đã thấy vết kiếm trên bụng dưới của Ma Gwang-ik-ju, do Yeongcheon Sword Demon gây ra.

Ye Gaju đề xuất một "thập ước chi chiến" (ten-way decision), tức là đặt ra các điều kiện cho Gaepa War, để "cứu vãn thể diện" cho Liên minh, tránh việc bị đánh bại quá dễ dàng. Jegal Hyeon và Jegal Cheong-a lặng lẽ lắng nghe cuộc thảo luận.

Sau cuộc họp, Jegal Liang trách Jegal Hyeon không thu thập được thông tin gì về Ma Gwang-ik-ju, và ra lệnh cho Jegal Cheong-a khám nghiệm tử thi của Thanh Kỳ Lân (Qing Qilin) và những người khác để phân tích võ công của Ma Gwang-ik-ju. Jegal Cheong-a miễn cưỡng làm theo, cô phát hiện ra nguyên tắc "trực giác, khẩn trương và nhanh chóng" trong võ công của Ma Gwang-ik-ju, và sự thật rằng dù là người có mọi thứ, nhưng Ma Gwang-ik-ju vẫn có gì đó thiếu sót.

Trong khi đó, chuỗi chiến thắng của Ma Gwang-ik-ju tiếp tục. Anh ta đối đầu với Cheonryonggeomdaeju của Thiên Lĩnh Kiếm Pháp (Cheonnyeong Swordsmanship). Cheonryonggeomdaeju muốn lợi dụng "thập ước chi chiến" để hạ thấp danh tiếng của Ma Gwang-ik-ju. Tuy nhiên, Ma Gwang-ik-ju tấn công bất ngờ với kiếm pháp nhanh đến mức Cheonryonggeomdaeju không kịp phản ứng, chỉ cảm thấy một luồng lạnh lẽo chạy dọc gáy.

Sarak.


A huge round table was covered with colorful clothes.


Figures wearing outstanding prayer robes were seated. Their colorful garments shone with luster.


They were all clean silk. As expected of the noble families of the Jeongpa clan who devoted themselves to morning exercises with a sharp mind, their complexions were extraordinary.


These are the people who sweat every day in the famous family. Not a single one of them skipped the bathing ritual.


“The sky was so blue. It was like spring.”


A middle-aged man with a noble appearance sits in the seat farthest from the door. In his left hand he holds a white crane with a blue handle.


The snow-white robe goes very well with her snow-white skin, and she has a slender face and thick eyebrows.


The handsome appearance of the dragon king, Jegal Hyeon.


It was the Zhuge family.




It is also called the reincarnation of Waryong.


He did not possess the wisdom of a genius. It means that he had the appearance and character to discuss with Empress Wu of Shu.


The sorcery and martial arts skills that were suitable for the status of Segaju also contributed to the nickname of Bokryong Hwansaeng (伏龍還生). Sometimes, there were even rumors that he was able to interfere with the weather.


Zhuge Liang continued speaking calmly.


“It was incredible to see the Sword of Youth cut across the sky. Wasn’t it so dazzling and beautiful?”


“… … .”


This is a story about the island’s beautiful Jeongyeonsin.


They gathered to discuss countermeasures.


Ma Gwang-ik-ju has decided to participate in the Gaepa War. The event that was supposed to show the face of the federation is about to get muddied.


The tyrannical appearance of the black boy with the yellow hair of the Ip Hwang Seong reminded some of the old gangsters of the tyrannical Ma Yeon Jeok.




A monster from the Imperial Palace wearing a purple robe at the age of thirty.


“I wanted to bear the shame. I made a difficult decision, but it seems that in life, everything is determined by fate. My bad tricks didn’t work.”


The head of the household smiles brightly.


Silence flowed. The atmosphere in the room was different from his expression. A cool air flowed through the antique round table.


There was no one who did not know that the real power of the Menghui was greatly angered.


“The leader?”


A middle-aged swordsman with sharp eyes suddenly asks.


Murong Gajuda. He wore a darker pink robe than his son, Murong Mingjun.


The sight of him lightly raising his hand to the sword in the meeting room seemed strangely natural. Any kind of eccentricity is permitted for the first prosecutor of Liaodong.


“Oh, that was disorganized.”




The smile of the Zhuge family deepened.


“The story I recited earlier was the words of the leader.”


“That lonely, innocent swordsman?”


The Murong family leader frowned and asked.


It was a solemn meeting room. Only the light coming through the window was coming in quietly. Dust slowly swam between the lights illuminating the table.


No one reacted even though Murong Gaju lightly referred to the swordsman. Only the expressions of some of the later strategists, including Zhuge Xuan and Gongsun Min, were slightly disturbed.


Jegal Hyeon and Ak Ye-rim, who had parted ways with Ma Gwang-ik-ju at Seobong-ro, returned safely.


Unfortunately, I never encountered the Yeongcheon Sword Demon while heading to Chiljunghyeop.


This is because he received a short letter from the spirit of the Jeomchangpa that Sogeomhu Cheolhwaok had. They were originally on friendly terms.


‘It’s uncomfortable.’


Jegal Hyeon thought.


No matter what others say, the boy he experienced as Ma Gwang-ik was quite innocent.


Even though he was young and possessed great wisdom, he listened to Zhuge Xuan’s story.


When dealing with the common people, he was a boy befitting his age. He also kept the death of the blue giraffe in his heart.


It would have been possible to sell them together with the Namgung Se family.


‘If Seomyega was a Sega figure, she would have belittled the character of the person who died by her own hand and said that her actions were appropriate. I’ve seen it too many times. Even in my hometown… . . ‘


Young Ma Gwang-ik-ju did not do that. He was a green swordsman like a sprout. He should not have been the target of such trickery.


At the moment when disillusionment rose to his throat, Seonryong Jegalhyeon heard a single word.


-Don’t show it, you stupid brother.


The girl sitting next to me absentmindedly lowered her eyes. She swept her black hair, tied in sky-blue silk, down the side of her neck, and paid no attention to the people in the room.




Jeongsim-an (靜深眼) Jegal Cheong-a (諸葛淸芽). She is Jegal Hyeon’s younger sister.


He was known as a prodigy in Anbeop Jeolhak at an early age. He was also famous for his beautiful appearance, just like his older brother.


Jegal Hyun opened his eyes wide when he heard her voice. He looked straight at his father.


Fortunately, Zhuge Liang was slowly nodding his head without looking at them.


The father of the Zhuge siblings spoke softly.


“It seems that our Geomseong has fallen for the qualities of the young lord of Iphwangseong. Isn’t that quite surprising? Many of the well-known feats of Seomye were achieved through martial arts rather than swordsmanship. It would be more appropriate to say that he is a natural fighter rather than a swordsman, but Geomseong’s eyes have seen a different side.”


“Actually, we don’t know what the leader is thinking. We should be concerned about uninvited guests. Isn’t it quite a sight? It’s gotten to the point where it’s hard to just sit by and watch the rampage.”


“Mr. Murong, please give me your opinion.”


“The head of the household examined the island carefully and confirmed a sword wound on the lower left abdomen. An extraordinary aura emanated from the scar. It was no ordinary mysterious sword wound.”


The chieftain laughed.


“I saw it too. It must have been a sword strike by Yeongcheon Sword Demon.”


“Since it is not a wound that will heal easily, it may be enough to find a way to buy time in a nice way. If you continue to fight without resting, the internal wounds will get worse. Our children may be able to achieve victory.”


A colorless light flashed across the eyes of Murong Jiaju as he finished speaking.


That was when.


Lady Ye, sitting at one end of the round table, slightly raises her head. The sunlight shines on her graceful jawline.

The head of the Ye clan next to me immediately responded. He was a man dressed neatly in pure white military attire, like the head of a prestigious family.


He raised his hand, gathered everyone’s attention, and slowly opened his mouth.


“The term ‘uninvited guest’ is misleading. Didn’t we invite you? We invited the envoy of the Imperial Palace to establish our own image. We declared to the world that we are not afraid of the royal guard dog.”


“Are you criticizing the poor response to the delayed schedule?”


The owner of the house asked.


“I’m saying that we need to have a more constructive discussion. Are you just wasting time? There’s no way that comes to mind… … Rather than that, how about a ten-way decision?”


It was a word that focused attention. The Ye clan was established together with clans such as the Hyeolyeon clan and the Myeong clan in the late Yuan Dynasty.


The financial power derived from the history of the clan that ruled the upper class was enormous.


He poured a huge amount of money into the establishment of the Murim Alliance and still served as its main source of funding.


This means that it has a great influence on the community.


Zhuge Liang showed interest.


“It’s a ten-game match. Are you saying that we should set conditions for the Gaepada War?”


“Isn’t the key now to establish the face of the true master? Whether you struggle against a young master or lose, or win with difficulty after a close fight like a wheel battle against a mid-level master, it’s a big loss. If you limit the sum, it’s power, but not power, and I think you can save face whether you win or lose. Let’s look at the big picture. Don’t get caught up in one person called Ma Gwang-ik-ju.”


Yegaju said. Jegalju gently stroked his smooth chin.


“Sure, that would give the lower class a chance to win against the upper class… … It would be a fight with many variables. That makes sense.”


“There are many reasons for this. These are very chaotic times, so wouldn’t it be okay to say that it’s to preserve the power of the Baekdo clan?”


The discussion continued.


Jegal Hyeon and Jegal Cheong’a just listened silently.


The same was true for Ak Ye-rim, Gongsun Min, and Murong Mingjun. They were not in a position to rashly express their opinions.


The conversation between the adults who were said to be moving the upper echelons of the Gangho was serious. It was like that until the meeting ended.




Ma Gwang-ik-ju, who had been hastily invited to a banquet by Ak Ye-rim and Mo Yong-myeong-jun a while ago, was clearly walking in a different realm from the later indexes.


“You and Seomye. I heard you became friends while heading to Seobong-ro.”


Zhuge Liang spoke as he left the meeting hall. He was accompanied by his two children, the later Jishu.


He spoke while staring ahead without looking at his children, and Jegal Hyun slightly lowered his head and opened his mouth.


“We just exchanged a few words.”


“That’s ridiculous. You’re saying you didn’t even dare to deceive that child? If it were your sister, she would have even found out the name of the concubine that Seomye had a crush on when she was young. Any information that Iphwangseong Black possesses should be treated as a treasure.”


“… … I’m sorry.”


“It was done.”


Zhuge Liang said indifferently.


“Cheong-ah, listen up.”


“yes.”


Jegal Qing’er, who was walking one step behind, answered quietly.


“We received the body of the Qing Qilin again. We were also able to rescue the bodies of some of the Sim Mu-ryeon guys who were attacked at Seobong-ro.”


“… … .”


“You take a look. I have already figured out many of the techniques of the Seomyeo Martial Arts… … but the outcome of the Ten Agreements is highly uncertain. Report back with a different perspective, without missing a single clue. The Magwangikju is very strong.”


“all right.”


The girl replied expressionlessly.


For a moment, Jegal Hyun’s face distorted. He didn’t like anything about it.


The siblings who submit to the oppression of their authoritarian father, and the father who engages in corruption in the name of justice.


I also had this same feeling of empathy with my close friend Namgung Sejin.




They were strong as Sega Sogaju and weak as Baekdo Muin. They lived until they were twenty-eight years old.


Jegal Hyeon watched his younger sister walk away with monotonous steps.


I thought to myself, I’m jealous of Namgung Sejin who met his end as he wanted.


The transparent sunlight was slanting. The autumn wind was stealing time and passing by.


Jegal Qingya had to examine the corpses that had been injured by Ma Guang Yi Zhu. The wounds from martial arts could tell us a lot.


The traces of the force applied can be used to determine the shape of the waves, and the path of the sword can be estimated from the trajectory left on the sword mark.


It was a little easier for her, especially when it came to the wounds of the living.


The girl mastered the secret art of the eye technique of the Zhuge Shi family at an early age. This is because she was possessed by the eyes of the family from birth and was forced to practice only the eye technique.


Among the Sega later index members, the outstanding qualities also played a part.


However, it was the first time that she had destroyed her martial arts skills with traces of a corpse. Her father used to push the limits of his brother and himself in this way.


He taught us to wear the mask of chivalry and pursue the interests of our family.


“Miss, why are you in a place like this… … .”


“I received an order.”


He replied in an emotionless tone.


I passed the panicked subordinates and crossed the threshold of the secret hall. The guide was immediately posted.


A man with no expression guided the girl. They walked very deep into the cave.


The things that pass through my sight are both familiar and unfamiliar. The dim sunlight, the dark floor, the cold texture that touches my feet.


The moment I entered the room at the end of the hall, an old retainer of the family stood guard outside the door.


Jegal Qing’er faced the five people lying down with their eyes closed. Her eyes shook slightly.


Sarak.




The girl bowed twice toward them. Her raven-black hair flowed down in a ponytail, and the hem of her sky-blue dress swept the floor twice.


Jegal Cheong-ah, who had raised his body, stared blankly down at Namgung Se-jin’s body.


The closed eyes are sunken and the pale complexion stands out.


Even if preserved with the magic of the Mosanpa, a corpse is still a corpse. Even after death, it cannot find peace. It was a price paid by being born into the powerful family of Sega and enjoying power.


It was very strange. The life of Qing Qilin and the fate of Zhuge Qing’er.


“Power aside… … .”


The girl muttered on purpose. She was tracing the traces of the sword running across Namgung Sejin’s body.


I wanted to get out of here quickly. I examined the scars that had reached up to my ribs and confirmed that my side had collapsed due to the method of attack.


I completely engraved the martial arts of Magwangikju Seomye in my eyes.


A light of energy formed in Jegal Qing’er’s pupils. The color of the leaves passed through his pitch-black eyes.


‘There is a principle that runs through all martial arts.’


The girl’s eyes widened. Something was approaching the realm of intuition.


The inspiration that often flashed through the minds of the reporters responded to the traces of the island. It ran with the spirit of genius.


Blue sparks flew from his eyes. They were eyes brimming with wisdom.


She thought.


‘Intuitive, urgent, and fast.’


A strange emotion appeared on the girl’s face.


What could a boy who could be called the best in his age group lack? I once thought that it was absurd for such talent to exist in the world.


Hwangbo Se-ga says that Tae-yeon-ryong’s qualities are the best in the world, but the Tae-yang-shin-maek is a constitution that comes with a price.


Why did Ma Gwang-ik-ju incorporate such a mindset into his own martial arts? As the youngest black man in the Ip Hwang-seong clan, he possesses everything.




‘The scars are getting deeper. That means the sword power is properly applied. The fact that the effective number of Kyungpa hits has noticeably increased means that the martial arts have steadily increased during the life-or-death battle… … There will be no other monster like this in the world.’


For the first time.


There was interest on the girl’s face.


I intentionally fostered the small emotions that arose in me, in order to endure the guilt of examining a corpse.


Jegal Qingya wondered what the most perfect boy in the world of martial arts had lacked.


Just as his older brother Jegal Hyeon became friends with Seomye after becoming friends with Cheonggi Rin, will he and the young Daeju of Iphwangseong be able to sympathize with each other and feel compassion?


\* \* \*


Magwangikju.


The winning streak of Seomye Jeongyeonshin continued without end. This was the case even after accepting the offer of a ten-match victory.


The boy was somewhat confused. It was a form of non-combat that was very advantageous to him.


Physically, it was the same, and from the perspective of having to deal with the Volcanic Sword.


Geomjeol is the strongest master in the Gaepa War.


It was said to be on par with the prime of his career. It was said to be a state where he could blossom with the sword.


The new leader of the Imperial Guard had a different level of confidence in swordsmanship. The longer the fight lasted, the more likely it was that he would lose.


‘So I was going to keep it short, but you made it a rule.’


The boy thought. Mo Yong-se was facing the leader of the Cheonnyeong Swordsmanship.


“I heard a rumor that you are a great master. Since all the disciplines are in your body from birth, it is not strange that you have been showing off such strength since you were young. Is that true? I just can’t believe it.”


The middle-aged swordsman in red asked.


He had narrow eyes set beneath wide eyebrows. His searching gaze was extremely sharp.


The upper echelons of the Murim Alliance have learned all about the martial arts that Seomye has shown.


The art of the magic sword takes the form of a single blow.


A powerful explosive martial art that seems to have been influenced by the Buddhist scriptures. It would have been very effective in areas where survival was at stake.


‘The world of true masters is different.’


The Heavenly Sword Master scanned the boy’s entire body.


In fierce battles between the best, the flow is contested. This is the reason why the beginner’s style is connected to the martial arts and swordsmanship styles.


This is also the reason why a ronin cannot defeat a master who has trained in martial arts.


If an opponent who can withstand single attacks takes the lead with systematic swordsmanship, he will inevitably be defeated.


There was no need for the rule of ten agreements. The leaders were mistaken in being afraid that the process of defeating them would be too long.


Even if the Menghui’s unmanned forces were defeated, they were in a hurry to create a form that would save face. Their position was different from that of the young Ma Gwang-ik-ju.


Cheonryonggeomdaeju continued speaking to the boy who did not answer.


“Because you are a monster with incredible strength, all sorts of rumors are going around. Most of them are probably false rumors. It’s a shame that there is no rule called the ten-harmony. Most swordsmen share their feelings through the vibration of their swords, but you won’t even receive a message in your hand.”


“The sword is long. Has the sword fight begun?”


Jeong Yeon-shin asked.


A long smile formed on the corner of Cheonryonggeomdaeju’s mouth. With a leisurely attitude, he flicked the sword wave that he hadn’t even drawn.


I wanted to use the rule of the ten agreements in reverse. Ip Hwang-seong has a personal grudge.


The plan was to defeat the bastard after showing off and greatly lower the reputation of the Black Order.


“Isn’t this body still yielding its power? You may come in at any time. I have already exchanged swords with the Immortal Tree Spirit Lord among you black ones… … .”


That was when.


A gust of wind blew.


Suddenly, a sword flashed in Cheonryonggeomdaeju’s sight.


‘What… …!’


The blade that held an endless history split the space between my eyes. The whistle engraved in the air seemed to transform into a sword in an instant.


I don’t even know when I first drew my sword. In an instant, a storm spread from the sudden rush of swordsmanship.


It was a creepy and eerie scene. The surrounding scenery became blurred. My eyes were filled with dots.


The swordsman of the Murong family drew his sword like lightning. He had no time to strike. He just struck upward.


Swaaaah!


The atmosphere was translucent and distorted as the sword passed through. There was no shock entering the palm. It was a false start that hit a weak point in psychological warfare.


Only the cold sensation running in a straight line across the nape of my neck was vivid.


The boy with the sword drawn from the side was belatedly seen in his black robe fluttering.


A pure white light spread from the blade and settled on the eyes of the Demon Sword Master.


A strange transcendence permeated the boy’s body. It was a strange prayer.


If Dharma had lived as a secular person, would he have acted like that? Maybe it feels that way because of the circumstances.


“I bet the message really didn’t go through! What great foresight!”


It was the audience seats. A guy with a sky blue hero hat on his forehead shouted.
