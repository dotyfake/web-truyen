## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Sau khi trở về từ Liên minh Murim (Murim Alliance), nhân vật chính (tôi) được cha khen ngợi vì tốc độ đã cải thiện đáng kể nhờ luyện tập Khinh Công (Kyungkong). Cha tiết lộ rằng thành tựu này có được là nhờ vào việc cậu đã hoàn toàn thích nghi với tốc độ của trận pháp khi di chuyển giữa trường chính và Liên minh Murim. Tuy nhiên, cha cậu cũng nhắc nhở rằng cậu cần cẩn thận hơn để tránh bị va vào cây cối.

Tối hôm đó, cậu gặp lại hai người bạn thân, Seo Dae-ryong, Ian và Jangho tại quán rượu Pungryu. Seo Dae-ryong kể về những cuộc phiêu lưu của mình ở Liên minh Murim và việc anh ta đã giành chiến thắng trong một cuộc thi không chính thức. Anh ta cũng chia sẻ về một người phụ nữ đã giúp đỡ anh, nhưng hóa ra lại là người của Thiên Minh Hội (Cheonmyeonghoe). Sau đó, Seo Dae-ryong tuyên bố rằng anh ta quyết định đi theo con đường của một người vô danh thực thụ, chịu ảnh hưởng từ Geommu-geuk và Hyeolcheon Doma, cũng như từ Ian và Jangho. Ian bày tỏ triết lý sống của mình về việc chấp nhận số phận, trong khi Jangho thú nhận rằng anh luôn sợ hãi cái chết.

Trong lúc đó, nhân vật chính nghe lỏm được cuộc trò chuyện của họ và cảm thấy vui vì họ đã trở lại bên nhau. Chủ quán rượu, Jo Chun-bae, tặng cậu một bình rượu để chào mừng sự trở lại an toàn của cậu. Sau khi rời quán rượu, cậu đến Chwimongru và gặp Chwima đang uống rượu một mình. Họ cùng nhau ra một hòn đảo giữa hồ và uống rượu. Cậu khen ngợi Chwima vì đã quan tâm đến Yeo-bin và mong muốn có ai đó như vậy bên cạnh cô ấy.

Trong cuộc trò chuyện, cậu biết được rằng cha cậu đánh giá cao Dokwang và Kwonma, nhưng không thích sử dụng độc dược. Chwima cũng tiết lộ rằng Kwonma là một người có ý chí kiên định và có thể trở thành một đồng minh tốt. Cậu quyết định sẽ cạnh tranh với anh trai mình để giành quyền kế vị và tin tưởng Chwima sẽ ủng hộ cậu.

Ngày hôm sau, cậu đến Đông Quyền Môn (Donggwonmun) để gặp Kwonma. Các thiết đầu quyền (Iron Fist) canh gác cổng nhìn cậu với ánh mắt dò xét vì tin đồn Kwonma đang đứng về phía Đại Công tước. Một thiết đầu quyền dẫn cậu vào bên trong, nơi cậu thấy những người đàn ông cởi trần với các cấp bậc và khả năng khác nhau, nhưng đều chung một niềm tin vào sức mạnh của nắm đấm trần.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-179/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-181/)Episode 180: If you don’t have any determination.




I can’t express in words what the wind sounds like.


If I had to describe it, it was like the sound of the wind blowing through the mysterious valley at the end of the world. It was such a cool and refreshing sound, a sound that didn’t seem to exist in this world.


The moment I heard the sound of Daesung’s speedboat, I knew in my gut that I would become addicted to this sound. It was a sound that was as captivating as the crazy speed.


At first I was fast.


The speed at which it reached Daesung was so fast that it was beyond description.


Of course, it was much faster than the actual state of the composition. When I first suggested that we have a running competition, I was prepared to show my father that I would bump into trees and roll around on the ground.


My father saw it and laughed. I was ready to make a big fuss.


But I ran better than I expected. My eyesight and body were able to support that fast speed. Perhaps it was because I had completely adapted to the speed of the formation while going back and forth between the main school and the Murim Alliance.


Thanks to this, even though I had just reached the top, I was able to run at a similar speed to my father.


But it required extreme concentration and mental effort. I slowed down because I felt dizzy and tired while running. As I slowed down, my father rushed up to me.




“It’s pretty good!”


“Whose son is that!”


My father looked surprised and amazed. Of course, there was no concession on his face. Whether it was his son or someone else, he was the one who would never give in if a fire was lit.


“Son, I have something to tell you.”


“What is it?”


It was at that very moment that I was feeling nervous inside because of the serious tone.


It was just then.


Bam!


I was looking at my father when I hit a tree and fell to the ground.


“I was telling you to be careful!”




I felt my father’s hearty laughter fading away.


I jumped up and ran after him. Fortunately, my self-defense gear protected me, so I was able to get up without any injuries.


“It’s foul, foul! Father!”


I threatened to call it foul play when I bumped into him while looking away. Of course, my father ran even faster without looking back.


I ran after my father again.


I could tell after running. What would decide this match wasn’t the type of martial arts. The quick steps of the Wind God’s Sabo and the Heavenly Horse Flight Technique were almost the same level of light martial arts.


The problem was his eyesight. His eyes couldn’t keep up with the top speed that Kyungkong could achieve.


So eventually, once I get used to it, I will definitely be able to win. Because I have eyesight that goes beyond the limit thanks to the Shinan technique.


I saw my father’s back in the distance and ran. Just like the first time I went hunting and saw my father’s back, now I see my father’s back as I run.


It looked lonely then, and it looks lonely now, but one thing has changed. It’s the way I look at it that has changed.




I liked this moment better than any other moment I had ever run in my life. I don’t know what my father thinks, but at least I felt that my thoughts toward him were growing.


The moment I thought of my father, I fell down again. Even if I lose focus for just a moment, I inevitably end up bumping into something and falling down.


I got up again and chased after him, but I was unable to catch up with my father.


When I arrived at the main school, my father went to Cheonma Hall first.


If it were me, I would have waited and teased him for a while, but my father knows how to hold back teasing. He will tease him the next time we meet.


I bowed my head in the direction of the Cheonma Hall and expressed my gratitude once again.


The great success of the Wind God’s Treasure is entirely thanks to my father. It’s not just that the speed of the speedy steps has become faster. The shadow step has become more stealthy, the flash step can escape from greater danger, and the King of Hell’s step has become the real King of Hell’s step.

That evening, the three drinking buddies gathered at the Pungryu tavern.


“It’s been a while since you came, so I’ll buy you drinks today.”


The owner, Cho Chun-bae, said that he would treat you to a drink today, especially to celebrate Seo Dae-ryong’s safe return. Seo Dae-ryong said that he would only accept the favor if you were sincere.


“I won the prize money this time at the non-competition competition. Today, I will buy you a drink. So, please prepare all the delicious food.”


“Congratulations on your win, Inspector!”


“thank you.”


“I hope everything is fine, Mr. Lee?”


“sure.”


As Jo Chun-bae went down to the first floor, Seo Dae-ryong’s boasting finally began.


“Ah, where should I begin to tell the wonderful adventures of this lonely investigator? Wow! When I first saw the Murim Alliance building, I felt destiny… .”


Ian and Jangho looked at each other and laughed as they watched Seo Dae-ryong begin his epic.


Because the story was so interesting, Seodaeryong’s adventures were not boring at all.




“You’re really amazing. Even though it was a non-competitive match, it was a real match, right? You don’t have much experience in real matches, and yet you won.”


Jang Ho-ya had a lot of practical experience, but Ian only practiced every day. That’s why Seo Dae-ryong’s achievement was so surprising and enviable.


“Of course, there were fateful and tragic encounters along the way.”


Seo Dae-ryong talked about the woman who supported him, even through the sad ending.


“… … She was a woman sent by Cheonmyeonghoe.”


Ian jumped up and cursed, and Jang-ho consoled him by saying that it was all part of experience. The two of them were so excited that Seo Dae-ryong felt like all the accumulated wounds were being relieved.


“That’s why I looked forward to this drinking party the most.”


“We waited longer.”


“Well, in that spirit, let’s have a toast.”


Seo Dae-ryong was so grateful to the two of them. The woman who was the most beautiful in the world and the leader of the elite organization of the Heavenly Demon Sect were waiting for him and listening to him. What did he say?


“I have something to tell you both. I, too, have decided to walk the path of a true unmanned being.”


The direct influences were Geommu-geuk and Hyeolcheon Doma, but the influence of these two people was also very great. I always had a desire to become someone who would not be ashamed of them.


Ian and Jangho sincerely congratulated them. The Hwangcheon-gak investigators were also unmanned, but Ian and Jangho knew that the unmanned Seo Dae-ryong was talking about now was a different kind of unmanned.


“Isn’t this something to celebrate? Honestly, I’m scared that I’ll die early. Aren’t you two scared?”


Then Ian smiled and said,

“I think that life and death are already determined. When and how I die are already determined. I feel at ease when I think that way.”


“This gentleman is a fatalist.”


“I think so.”


Jang-ho, on the other hand, had different thoughts.


“I always live in fear of death.”


“Really? I think it would be you, Lord Jang, who would not be afraid of death.”


“No. I wake up many times while I sleep. I also often dream about dying.”


It was something that neither Ian nor Seo Dae-ryong knew about.


The story of life and death continued. Then Seo Dae-ryong became interested.


“I almost died this time too.”


Seo Dae-ryong suddenly got up and unbuttoned his upper garment.


“There are four wounds left on my body by the Jeongpa bastards. This wound on my shoulder, the wound from the Palgang match. There are two holes, right? This one here in the finals, this one here… … .”


\* \* \*


I was overhearing a conversation between three people next to the first floor checkout counter.


Jo Chun-bae and I laughed together at the sight of Seo Dae-ryong unbuttoning his clothes.


It’s a drinking party that anyone who sees it will immediately rush to join.


Jo Chun-bae said with a kind face.


“They are really good people. When one person is gone, the other two come and miss that one person.”


There were times when Ian wasn’t there, and times when Seo Dae-ryong wasn’t there.


“I’m going back now.”




“Didn’t you come here to join us?”


“It’s so much fun, but I think we should get the three of us together today.”


“Then please wait a moment.”


Jo Chun-bae went to the kitchen and brought a bottle of alcohol.


“This is the wine I saved. Take it, have a drink, and go to sleep. This is a gift to celebrate your safe return. Welcome back safely.”


Jo Chun-bae was truly happy for my return, like family.


“I recently met a valuable person in the martial arts world. Next time we have a drink, I will introduce you to him.”


“Then it’s good for me.”


You would never dream that he was the leader of the martial arts world. But who knows what happens in life? There may come a day when the leader of the martial arts world will be having a drink at a bar.


“Thank you for the alcohol.”


So we said goodbye and left the tavern.


I returned home under the moonlight. There were other people I wanted to see. Go-wol and the leader of the Pungcheon Church. I wanted to rush over there right away, but they were too far away from the main church.


I had a lot to do after being away from school for a long time and I had to come back. So I guess I’ll have to put off seeing them for a while. They didn’t worry. They were together.


On my way to my residence, I turned my steps toward Daechurim. When I thought about who I would like to drink with now that I was awake, Chwima came to mind first.


Indeed, Chwima was drinking alone in Chwimongru.


The drunken woman took me on a boat and headed to an island in the middle of the lake.


“Do you still drink a lot these days, Mr. Chwima?”


“You’ve lost a lot of weight compared to before. You’re only drinking one bottle today.”


“That’s fortunate.”


“Thanks to you, Mr. Lee Gongja.”




“Isn’t that my fault? It’s because of your concern and care.”


I knew that Yeo-bin liked drinking, so I spoke nicely to her. I thought it would be nice to have a woman like this by her side to take care of drinking. But in order to be able to talk properly, she had to be a wife, not a subordinate.


I wish I could step forward and take over, but I had no intention of doing so. If I got involved in a wrong way, I could ruin a relationship that was going well.


From the railing of the Chwimongru, Chwima looked this way and waved his hand.


I called him loudly.


“brother.”


Since it was just the two of us, I called him hyung comfortably. Chwima showed with his expression how much a single title can make someone feel good.


“Is your little brother here?”


“My poor brother, Sa-deung, came because I thought you’d drink alone.”


“Where is the Palmazone in the middle? Even the middle is not easy.”


So the ship arrived at the island and boarded the Chumongroo.


“What’s happening all of a sudden?”


“I wanted to have a drink.”


“Welcome.”


Chwima and I drank together. We didn’t say anything and just drank quietly.


Since the drunkard knows alcohol well, he also knows the drinker well. Does the other person want to drink while having a conversation, or does he want to drink quietly with the moon rising over the lake as an accompaniment?


“I went hunting with my father.”


“It seems like you’ve been away for quite some time this time. That’s amazing. How can you spend so much time alone with the leader? I’m going crazy.”


“It can be surprisingly crazy fun.”


Chuma shook his head, saying that there was no way that could happen.




I have to see my father cook, but I regret not being able to say anything.


“I found out while talking to my father, but it seems like he thinks highly of the Dokwang and the Kwonma.”


“If the leader is highly regarded, he will be a great leader.”


Chwima said decisively.


“Not the Poison King?”


“The leader originally didn’t like using poison. He’s never said it out loud, but it’s something everyone knows. Even the poison king knows, but he pretends not to know.”


“Then why is Kwon-ma held in such high esteem?”


I said I was researching the Amazons, but when I returned and met them, I felt it again. To say that you know a person, you have to meet them in person, talk to them, and experience them. But even so, I don’t know much about people. What I knew was their actions, not them. The same goes for Kwon Ma.


“There was one time when Kwon-ma and I drank together.”


“how was it?”


Chwima looked down at his glass for a moment, recalled that time, and then took a sip.


“It won’t be easy to beat this guy unless you have some determination. That’s what I thought.”


It was the first time I heard that a chummi held other mazons in such high esteem.


“But why Kwonma?”


“I was thinking of making one more person behind my brother.”


Chwima asked worriedly, as it meant that he was trying to draw Kwonma to our side.


“If you touch Kwon Ma in this situation, the Archduke won’t stay still, right?”


“That’s why. Don’t just stay still.”


“what do you mean?”


“It’s about time I start competing with my brother, right?”




As it meant that a full-scale battle for succession was about to begin, Chwima’s gaze also became intense.


“Are you sure?”


“I’ll go ahead and trust you, hyung.”


Chwima smiled and shook the empty bottle of alcohol at the words that he trusted his brother to deal with him.


“Hearing that makes me want to drink another bottle.”


I poured my last drink into his glass.


“Hold on. From now on, you’ll have to stay awake a lot.”


\* \* \*


The next afternoon, I headed to Donggwonmun where the undefeated horse was.


“I came to see the master.”


The Iron Fist guarding the entrance looked at me with surprised faces. It was because there was an open rumor that their leader, Kwon Ma, was on the side of the Grand Duke.


“Please follow me.”


An iron fist guided me.


The eyes of the iron fists going back and forth through the Dongkwonmun were focused on me. White uniforms, blue uniforms, red uniforms, black uniforms. Their uniform colors were different according to their status. Their genders, ages, and physical abilities were also different. However, they had one thing in common.


The fact that he is bare-chested without a single piece of metal attached to his body.


I walked slowly between the iron fists that staked their lives on their bare fists.
