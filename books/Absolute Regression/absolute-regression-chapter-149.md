# Absolute Regression Chapter 149 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Sau khi đánh nhau với đám ác nhân, Lee Gongja vui mừng khi thấy Huyết Thiên Đao Ma (Bloodthirsty Demon) xuất hiện kịp thời để giúp đỡ. Huyết Thiên Đao Ma trách mắng Nhị Diện Nhân (two-faced man) lớn tuổi mà còn ức hiếp đàn em. Hắn ta và Lee Gongja hợp sức chống lại Nhị Diện Nhân, khiến hắn phải bỏ chạy.

Lee Gongja chữa trị vết thương cho Tà Thần (evil Soma). Tà Thần cảm kích vì Lee Gongja đã cứu mình, và cả hai đều nhớ lại khoảnh khắc cận kề cái chết. Lee Gongja ôm Huyết Thiên Đao Ma để bày tỏ lòng biết ơn, nhưng bị ông đẩy ra.

Huyết Thiên Đao Ma nhắc nhở Lee Gongja rằng cậu đang khuấy động thế giới võ thuật. Lee Gongja đáp lại rằng cậu sẽ đánh thức tất cả bọn họ. Cậu đề nghị Huyết Thiên Đao Ma và Tà Thần cùng cậu chiến đấu.

Trong khi đó, Tư Mã Minh (Sima Ming) mang tin khẩn cấp đến Thiên Ma Điện (Cheonmajeon), báo cáo rằng Lee Gongja đã đụng độ với các ác nhân của Tà Phái (Evil Song), bao gồm Thiên Đường Tiên Tử (Paradise Fairy), Huyết Ma (Blood Lord), Diêm Vương (King of Hell), Huyết Lang Đồ (Blood Rangdo), Quái Vật (Monster) và Thiết Liên Nhân (Iron Chainsman). Tư Mã Minh báo cáo rằng Tà Thần và Lee Gongja đã tiêu diệt tất cả bọn chúng.

Thiên Ma Kiếm Vũ Trấn (Cheonma Geomwoojin) bình tĩnh đánh giá tình hình và hỏi về Mugeuk. Tư Mã Minh nói rằng cậu vẫn ổn. Thiên Ma Kiếm Vũ Trấn ra lệnh điều tra về Thiên Mệnh Hội (Cheonmyeonghoe), kẻ chủ mưu đằng sau vụ việc. Ông ta cũng tăng số lần hỗ trợ từ Thiên Ma Điện cho Lee Gongja từ một lên ba.

Lee Gongja, Huyết Thiên Đao Ma, và Tà Thần nghỉ ngơi để hồi phục. Sau đó, Lee Gongja nhận được tin nhắn từ Thiên Ma Điện yêu cầu cậu tiếp tục nhiệm vụ.

Khi Lee Gongja đi dạo trong vườn, cậu thấy Huyết Thiên Đao Ma đang luyện võ. Họ trò chuyện về việc trở thành một Ma Nhân (Amazon) không phải là chuyện đùa. Tà Thần xuất hiện và cảm ơn Lee Gongja vì đã cứu mình. Huyết Thiên Đao Ma thừa nhận sức mạnh của Tà Thần.

Lee Gongja nói rằng cậu cảm thấy như mình đã vượt qua giới hạn trong trận chiến vừa qua. Cả ba người đều đồng ý rằng họ cần phải bắt giữ Cừu Mục (sheep shepherd). Lee Gongja cho rằng Cừu Mục đang ẩn náu ở Ác Nhân Cốc (Akingok). Tà Thần bất ngờ nói rằng anh ta biết rõ về Ác Nhân Cốc vì đã từng ở đó khi còn trẻ.

Lee Gongja thông báo về việc Thiên Ma Điện tăng cường hỗ trợ. Cậu quyết định sử dụng một trong những cơ hội đó. Cậu nói rằng cậu sẽ gọi Nhất Hoa Kiếm Tôn (Ilhwageomjon) và Đại Túy Ma (Daechwima) để đi bắt Cừu Mục.

“Elder!”


When I saw the Bloodthirsty Horse, I jumped for joy and shouted. Since I met him, had I ever been this happy to see him?


He pulled out the Heavenly Sword, which was half-embedded in the Bloody Sword that had fallen to the ground.


“Why is someone who has reached his age persecuting his juniors?”


Bloodthirsty Demon rebuked him sternly.


Instead of an answer, a bloody letter flew in.


Bam!


Blood Heavenly Sword Demon unleashed a blast and dispelled the Blood Angji. Blood Heavenly Sword Demon was not pushed back at all in terms of internal energy. Blood Heavenly Sword Demon, who had been training hard in martial arts recently, was sharper than ever.


The bloodthirsty demon suddenly shouted.


“You ugly old man! Do you want to die?”




The sword of destruction was swung greatly.


Phaaaang!


The sword wind that came out of the island tore through space and flew away.


The two-faced man did not dodge, but instead struck out with his sword to release his tension.


Kwaaaaang!


With an ear-piercing roar, the two men were pushed back. The number of people who stepped back was the same. The power of the Blood Heavenly Sword was truly profound, and it was not pushed back at all by the Yang Cheo Ki.


I also joined the fight right away. If I fought alone and got hurt, it would have been a big problem.


Clang. Clang.


As he unleashed the Seventh Form of the Heavenly Sword Technique, the Black Demon Sword split into twelve sword energies that rose into the air. Although he didn’t have much internal energy left, he intentionally showed off his internal energy and split it as much as possible.


When he saw me trying to join the fight, Yang Cheo-gi judged that the situation was unfavorable and quickly kicked himself away and disappeared from there.




“Don’t chase after me.”


I was worried that the Bloodthirsty Demon might chase after him, but he didn’t move at all.


“Even phlegm won’t go away. I thought my arm would fall off when we were dividing the work a little while ago. He’s as strong as he is ugly.”


“Compared to that guy, you are a peerless handsome man!”


“Of course.”


“Elder!”


I ran over and tried to hug him, but he dodged the Bloodthirsty Demon’s step.


“disgusting.”


“How did you get here?”


“I happened to be passing by.”




How could that be? The Bloodthirsty Demon was watching my movements because he was worried about me.


“Thank you. If it weren’t for you, we would have died here.”


It wasn’t just the public announcement. If he hadn’t come, it’s really impossible to know what the outcome of the fight would have been.


The evil Soma collapsed from his seat. His mask was covered in blood, and his entire body was covered in wounds and blood.


“Elder, please stand guard for a moment.”


“Okay then.”


I placed my hand on the back of the evil soma and injected a ray of internal energy. I slowly took care of his blood vessels, boosted his vital energy, and treated his internal injuries. As the pure internal energy healed his body, the evil soma quickly opened his eyes. Fortunately, the internal injuries were not that deep.


“Thank goodness the wound isn’t that deep.”


The evil Soma looked at me. I can’t forget it. The look in his eyes when he sensed his end, the regret that filled his eyes.


We easily forget those intense moments that changed me and my life. Once they pass, we can no longer live like those moments.


But I won’t do that. I don’t need anything else in my relationship with him anymore. I just need to remember the regret I felt at that moment when I sensed death.


What about you, Extreme Soma? Do you feel the same way as I do?


The evil Soma just laughed. For the first time, he laughed with all his emotions. I laughed too.


Yeah. Drink with Chwima and laugh with Soma. That’s it.


Next, the evil soma expressed his gratitude to the bloodthirsty soma. He bowed his head slightly without saying a word.


Bloodthirsty Horseman also greeted me with just a nod.


I took the opportunity to hug the blood claw machine.


“Elder! I missed you.”


“I told you it was gross, so why are you doing this?”


The blood clot fell down as if it was running away, shaking me off like a child. But how could I not know? He also felt really good about saving me.




I spoke honestly as I retrieved the eternal iron dagger that had fallen next to the corpse of the Iron Chainsman.


“This fight was pretty tough.”


Watching that scene, Hyeolcheondoma spoke to me.


“I told you, you’re waking up the world of martial arts.”


“Should I go somewhere and learn a lullaby?”


“Then, in the process of learning that, even those who don’t need to wake up will all wake up.”


I said in a confident voice to Hyeolcheon Doma’s joke.


“Since it has come to this, tell them all to wake up. Tell them all to wake up later and not talk in their sleep. Instead… … .”


I said after making eye contact with the two people.


“Please fight with me from now on.”


The Bloodthirsty Demon, who had been staring at me for a moment, suddenly turned around and walked away, and the Evil Demon followed behind him.


“Here you go again, here you go again.”


I followed them and got out of there.

Sima Ming, holding the urgent letter in his hand, carried it to Cheonmajeon. His faster pace than usual told him that the information he was carrying was important.

Even though he saw the urgency, Cheonma Geomwoojin was as calm as usual.


Sima Ming, who arrived at the end of the red carpet, quickly delivered the news.


“This time, during the mission, Lee Gongja clashed with the villains of the Evil Song.”


“A song about evil?”


“These are the Paradise Fairy, the Blood Lord, the King of Hell, and the Blood Rangdo.”


“Someone with some real skills has come out.”


“It’s not just them. Even the monsters and the iron chains have appeared.”


When the names of the two people were mentioned, Geum Woo-jin flinched. The first four were not easy men, but the two mentioned later were definitely not people to be taken lightly.


“They clashed with the scientist and the evil Soma.”


“Was there a super evil soma?”


“Yes. It seems that the evil Soma is also involved in this matter.”


“so?”


After a short pause, Sima Ming reported.


“The evil soma and the evil dwarf killed them all.”


“Even if the first four were like that, the last two wouldn’t have been easy.”


“It is said that the evil Soma suffered internal injuries during the process. Fortunately, it is said that the internal injuries were not deep.”


“What about Mugeuk?”


“it’s okay.”


“You two killed the monster and the iron chain?”


Unlike the calm Geom Woo-jin, the great general Sima Ming was slightly excited.




“Actually, I was very surprised when I saw the book. Previously, Lee Gongja and the Evil Soma joined forces to kill the Sword Emperor, but at that time, they only had one opponent. On the other hand, this time, there were many enemies, so it definitely wouldn’t have been easy.”


If there had been no fight with Geommu-geuk at the Pungryu Tavern the other day, Geom Woo-jin would have been equally surprised. Geom Woo-jin had already been surprised that day.


“Who is behind this?”


“The real mastermind behind this is Cheonmyeonghoeju, and the ones who took the lead and carried out the work are Yang Cheogi and Ak Ingokju.”


“A sheep shepherd? The sheep shepherd with a white face?”


Geum Woo-jin knew about him.


“Yes. It seems like he did it because of a grudge against the evil Soma.”


“But you mobilized such grandiose people?”


“According to the report of the scholar, Cheonmyeonghoeju has recruited Akin Gokju and Yang Cheogi. However, it seems that while recruiting Yang Cheogi, he secretly offered him the position of Akin Gokju.”


“Why would that be? From Cheonmyeonghoeju’s perspective, Akingokju would be more useful than Yangcheogi in many ways.”


“I think there must be an ulterior motive.”


“You should find out.”


“Yes! The Cheonmyeonghoe were more troublesome than we thought.”


Until now, I only knew Cheonmyeonghoe as a group of people pretending to be Cheonmasingyo and seeking unfair profits. But now I see that it is a much larger and stronger organization.


“What should we do? It might be difficult for a person with engineering skills to deal with. Why don’t you just call him in?”


But Geum Woo-jin shook his head.


“That mission was chosen by the child himself, wasn’t it? Then you should take responsibility for it. But this time, turn a blind eye to the intervention of the demons. And increase the number of times you can support our school from once to three.”


“All right.”


Since this was originally a mission that had to be done alone, it was not right for the Amazons to intervene like this.


However, since a special situation has unfolded beyond the test, the difficulty level has been adjusted accordingly.




“We will focus our information network and keep an eye on Cheonmyeonghoe.”


Geum Woo-jin nodded and said.


“Tell the second one that the tests will continue.”


\* \* \*


We stayed at the main house of our school, not far from the Hwangha guesthouse where the fight took place.


We rested for a few days to recover our internal energy and heal our wounds. We ate a proper meal and had a good breakfast to get enough rest.


And today, a message arrived from Cheonmajeon telling me to continue the mission.


I thought of him as my father. Even if I sent him a letter saying that I would fight against the Murim Alliance, he would reply saying that I should fight well.


That night, as I was walking around Anga’s garden enjoying the quiet moonlight, I saw Hyeoncheon Doma practicing martial arts in the corner of the yard.


“Do you practice here too?”


“Is training a joke? It depends on the location.”


“These days, when I meet older people, I often think that becoming a Amazon is no joke.”


“Don’t lie. You’re making fun of us.”


“You misunderstand!”


To be honest, when I first decided to control the Amazons, I thought it was ridiculous. But as I got closer to them, I stopped thinking like that. These people are definitely not easy people.


That’s probably why Yangcheogi couldn’t become Amazon.


Apart from his martial arts skills, he lacks something crucial that can make him a Demon Lord. Should I say he lacks charm? Should I say he lacks feeling? Should I say he lacks class? There is something missing from him.


“I guess I didn’t know that the Amazon was scary because I only see drunkards these days.”


“You shouldn’t laugh at that drunkard either.”


“Why are you worrying about me so much these days?”




“Aren’t you worried? You keep getting into danger like this whenever you get a chance. I should take out some pocket money and buy you some other clothes. By the way, what about the secret service?”


“I took it.”


I didn’t say I fed him the worst soma. If I had done that, our old man might have been whining all night and not been able to sleep.


That was when.


“I ate that.”


When I looked back, I saw the evil Soma walking out into the garden.


“Thanks to you, I survived.”


Then he bowed his head slightly. At that polite attitude, Hyeolcheon Doma only glared at me once, and did not say anything that would needlessly irritate the evil Soma.


“I hope you are safe.”


How urgent must it have been for him to fight while eating all of that? How could Bloodthirsty Doma not know that? He would always curse him behind his back, calling him a sinister man, but he still acknowledged the power of the evil Soma.


“I’ll repay your kindness next time.”


“Before that, I should wipe off some of the blood on that mask.”


“I plan to use it as is until I finish this work.”


I felt that the evil Soma was slightly reminded of me. It wasn’t just a feeling of anger. It was closer to the excitement I felt when I fought a battle that was on the brink of life and death for the first time in a long time.


I was the same. In the last fight, I experienced that the speed of my sword swing became faster. It was due to the desperation to save the evil Soma, but in any case, I surpassed the limit of what I could do. That is important. I broke through the limit. Since the Bicheon Sword Technique has already achieved the Twelve Great Stars, this improvement must be related to my overall martial arts level.


“I felt like I was on the edge a few times, but honestly, I felt great.”


Even the most evil of evil spirits looked in agreement with what I said.


Even the Bloodthirsty Demon nodded.


“Everyone is going crazy because of that taste.”


It seems that the blood of Hyeolcheon Doma also started to boil as he exchanged swords with Yang Cheo-gi.




“First, we need to catch the sheep.”


Not only did Yang Cheo-gi try to kill us, but he also tried to drive the disciples of the evil soma sect, Baek-Myeon-Mun, to their deaths. He will continue to target the evil soma and me in the future, so we must deal with him as a top priority.


“Besides, since he has met the Master of the Heavenly Mansion in person, he will also be helpful in finding the Master of the Heavenly Mansion.”


Then the Bloodthirsty Demon asked.


“Do you know where that bastard Yang Cheo-gi is?”


“He must have hidden in Akingok. Those who were taken out from there died, so he must have reported it, and it is also the safest place. Also, Yang Cheo-gi is aiming for the position of Akingokju, so he must have returned there.”


“I will help you.”


When Bloodthirsty Demon offered to help, the Evil Demon said something unexpected.


“I know a lot about evil songs.”


After a pause, he added:


“I was there once too.”


I asked in surprise.


“When was it?”


“When I was young, my master sent me there to cultivate evil thoughts. He came to get me three years later.”


“What if you died there?”


“Then you must have found another disciple.”


“Did you survive the evil song at such a young age, Soma?”


The evil Soma nodded.


“Even Akingok is a place where people live. While there are masters like Goema, there are also people who don’t know martial arts at all. There are even people who are not from Akingok who steal goods and do business there. There are many hidden treasures. But you shouldn’t let your guard down. If you go in without any information, there is no place as scary as Akingok.”


I relayed to both of them the contents of the telegram that had arrived from our school.


“I received a call from our school today. The mission to eliminate Cheonmyeonghoeju is still valid, but we have strengthened our support by allowing you to receive help from our school three times. I think we will use one of them this time. The three of us can handle it, but the evil song master may appear during the process. There is no need to take unnecessary risks. After all, we are only using one opportunity.”


He spoke with a strong spirit, as if he was going to completely wipe out all the evil songs.


“Let’s call Ilhwageomjon and Daechwima and go catch Yangcheogi.”
