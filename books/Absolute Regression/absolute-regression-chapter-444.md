# Absolute Regression Chapter 444 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Chương truyện bắt đầu với việc nhân vật chính (tạm gọi là cậu) cảm thấy mọi ánh mắt đổ dồn vào mình, như thể đang đứng trên một sân khấu lớn. Cậu không hề đơn độc, vì sau lưng cậu là Soma tà ác, và những người đang nhìn cậu đều là Ma Tôn (Demon Lords) của cha cậu, dù trong thâm tâm cậu, họ cũng là Ma Tôn của riêng cậu. Cậu ý thức được rằng mối quan hệ của cậu với các Amazon có được là nhờ cậu là con trai của cha mình.

Chwima đề nghị được rót rượu cho cậu, với mong muốn cậu suy nghĩ lại. Cậu biết Chwima không muốn võ lâm chìm trong biển máu và hy vọng cậu sẽ tìm ra cách giải quyết. Cậu uống rượu và chia sẻ suy nghĩ của mình với Chwima, nhận ra rằng việc thay đổi ý định của cha là không hề dễ dàng, nhưng cậu là người duy nhất có thể làm được.

Lúc này, Huyết Thủ Thiên Ma (Bloodthirsty Demon) nhắn nhủ cậu nên từ bỏ, vì ước mơ của cha cậu và cậu đi theo hai đường thẳng song song, không thể hòa giải. Cậu hỏi cha về giấc mơ của ông, liệu nó có còn khiến ông hào hứng như xưa hay đã trở thành một điều hiển nhiên. Cậu mong cha có thể mơ lại từ đầu, từ một trạng thái không có giấc mơ nào cả.

Cậu bày tỏ lòng mình, rằng cậu không muốn chống lại ý muốn của cha, người mà cậu kính trọng nhất trên đời. Cậu nói về tầm quan trọng của những điều nhỏ nhặt trong cuộc sống, như bữa tối, những cuộc gặp gỡ, và những cảnh vật trên đường đời. Cậu muốn chơi cờ vây với cha, tắm suối nước nóng, du ngoạn Trung Nguyên. Cậu cũng muốn chiến đấu với Kiếm Tôn (Sword Master), đọc sách với Đồ Ma (Doma), đào thảo dược độc với Độc Vương (Poison King), uống rượu với Túy Quỷ (Drunken Master), và ngắm tượng đá của Ma Phật (Ma-bul).

Cậu nói rằng giấc mơ của cha có quá ít lựa chọn, và người đi trên con đường của Thiên Mã (Heavenly Horse) không cần nhiều cột mốc. Nhưng cha cậu khẳng định dù có hàng trăm lựa chọn, ông vẫn sẽ chọn con đường này.

Cậu đề nghị một lời hứa giữa hai người đàn ông, giữa một lãnh đạo và một thuộc hạ, giữa cha và con trai: cho cậu thời gian năm năm. Trong thời gian đó, cậu sẽ cố gắng thay đổi ý định của cha. Nếu sau năm năm, cha cậu vẫn muốn thống nhất võ lâm, cậu sẽ đứng ở tiền tuyến của cuộc chiến đó.

Lời đề nghị này gây sốc cho cả cha cậu và đám Ma Tôn. Cậu quyết tâm trong vòng năm năm sẽ tiêu diệt hết đám Hwamoogi và thay đổi suy nghĩ của cha, mang đến cho ông một giấc mơ mới. Cậu tin rằng, nếu thắng cược này, cha cậu sẽ có được cậu, người đã đạt được Thập Nhị Đại Tinh của Cửu Hoa Ma Công (Twelve Great Stars of the Nine Flower Demonic Arts) bằng Thần Thiên Bí Kỹ (Shicheon Secret Art).

Cha cậu đồng ý lời hứa này. Cậu chốt lại rằng, năm năm sau, vào ngày này, cậu sẽ mời tất cả các Ma Tôn đến đây và hỏi lại về giấc mơ của cha mình.

Sau đó, cậu hỏi cha rằng liệu ông có chuẩn bị cho việc thống nhất võ lâm khi gặp gỡ các Ma Tôn hay không, nhưng cha cậu phủ nhận. Ông chỉ gặp gỡ ba người: Soma, Chwima và Độc Vương, mỗi người vì một lý do riêng.

Cậu nhận ra rằng cha cậu đã có sự thay đổi trong suy nghĩ gần đây. Ông chỉ đơn thuần gặp gỡ các Ma Tôn vì những lý do cá nhân, không hề có kế hoạch thống nhất võ lâm. Hóa ra, cuộc gặp mặt hôm nay là do cậu gây ra, và cha cậu chỉ đến để "gói ghém" lại mọi chuyện.

Cậu nhận ra mình đã bị "mắc bẫy", nhưng hóa ra, đây lại là một tình huống "win-win" cho cậu. Ít nhất, cậu sẽ không phải lo lắng về chiến tranh trong vòng năm năm tới. Cha cậu đã cho cậu một cơ hội, một trận đấu kéo dài năm năm, để cậu chứng minh rằng có một giấc mơ tốt đẹp hơn Murimiltong (thống nhất võ lâm).

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-443/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-445/)444  

When all eyes were on me, I felt like I was standing alone on the stage.




But I wasn’t lonely.


There was an extremely evil Soma behind me, and the people looking at me were also my Demon Lords. In fact, they were my father’s Demon Lords and were on my father’s side, but in my heart, they were also my Demon Lords.


Of course, we must not forget one thing. My relationship with these Amazons was possible because I was my father’s son in the first place.


That’s why this stage is important. I have to do well on this stage. Whether I win or lose, I have to do it with dignity and nobility.


Because this is my father and I’s first stage.


First of all, you must never damage the dignity and authority of your father in front of the demons. This is the principle of this fight.


‘Father, do you know that I care that much? That is why this fight is so difficult for me.’


My father’s gaze turned to me. I couldn’t tell how much of what I had said earlier had been conveyed to him.


The one who broke the silence was Chwima.


“Cult Leader, I would like to offer a drink to the junior cult leader. Is that okay?”




The father nodded at Chwima’s request.


Chwima poured alcohol into the Ice Palace Holy Grail.


“Little Master, please have a drink from me and change your mind.”


Although he was on his father’s side, Chwima’s true feelings were different.


-I don’t want the martial arts world to become a sea of ​​blood, so use your good head to figure out a way!


Between my father and me, I had no choice but to choose my father, but Chwima was against the war. This drink was the drink of support.


“I will drink it with gratitude.”


We drank slowly and shared stories and opinions.


-As you can see, it is not easy to change father’s mind.


-But you are the only one here who can do that job.




“Thank you for the drink.”


At that moment, the Bloodthirsty Demon sent a message.


– Give up. The leader and your dream are running parallel. They can never be reconciled.


He must have judged that no matter how much I tried to persuade him, I could not change my father’s wishes.


Bloody Cheon Do Ma’s words are right. How could I easily change the dream my father has cherished for so long?


I asked my father calmly.


“I want to ask you this. Do you often think about that dream, father?”


My father looked at me with an expression that asked what I meant.


“When we dream, we feel excited and thrilled at first, but as time passes, that dream becomes a given, right?”


My father’s eyes wavered slightly. That wish must have been a ‘natural’ dream for him too.




“Father, you can have the same dream. But can you not dream it again from the beginning? You can dream it again from a state where there was no dream at all. Not a dream from a long time ago that you can’t even remember when, but a vivid dream right now.”


My father didn’t answer.


“I thought about this the whole time I met the demons. Can I really go against my father’s will? Am I worthy of doing so? That’s why I even met my soldiers. I came here to steel my heart after meeting them, but when I met my father, my heart wavered again.”


It was my true heart to my father.


“I don’t want to go against my father’s will that much. I respect him more than anyone else in the world.”


It’s not flattery. It’s my true feelings toward my father that I’m revealing in front of all the demons. My father still listened to me without changing his expression.


Today, my father is dealing with me not by talking but by listening. Thanks to that, today, this stage was truly mine.


“I know very well how important my father’s dreams, his wishes and ideals are. The magic I mentioned is also a part of my dream. But I think there is something equally important.”


“What is that?”


“What to eat for dinner, who to meet tomorrow. I think that everyday life is as important as grand dreams. It’s the scenery we see as we go toward our dreams.”


Firearms are also the reason why I try to live my life without being engrossed in them, even when faced with a formidable enemy.


This is the principle I have been following in my life since I returned, but I don’t know how convincing my father will be when I say it to him when I am still young. But I did my best.


“It is important for me to win a game of baduk with my father, and it is also important for me to fulfill my wish to take a hot spring bath with my father. I also earnestly wish to travel around the Central Plains with my father. If I cannot achieve these things and see my father, who has achieved unification of the martial arts world, sitting on the throne, will I be happy?”


And that’s not all? My gaze turned to the Amazons.


“It is important for me to have a fight with the Sword Master, and it is also important to practice late at night with the Master. I want to read a book with Doma-nim when he reads a book. I will dig up poisonous plants with the Poison King, drink with the Drunken Master, and watch the stone statue that Ma-bul-nim is completing. I will also watch the growth of the Sub-Hon-Ma-Jon. And there are still many pieces of furniture that I want to put in Soma-nim’s room. These things are as important to me as my dreams. When I look back before I die, I will miss and regret all these moments so much.”


Every moment was incredibly lonely and difficult, but when I looked back after it had passed, it was a life that had passed in the blink of an eye. Because I had experienced it.


What I had to say from now on was something I had to say carefully.


“I think the dream that my father had for a long time was a dream with too few options. A person walking the path of the Heavenly Horse would not need many milestones.”


But my father’s thoughts were firm.


“Even if there were a hundred choices, I would have chosen the same one. Even if there were dozens of forks in the road, I would have continued on the path I was on.”




“I’m not telling you to go a different way.”


“What does that mean?”


“He told me to go while looking at the surrounding scenery.”


So sometimes I stop walking, sometimes I wonder if there is another path, and sometimes I doubt my own path.


To do that, I have to walk with my father. We have to talk while walking together, and when we come across a view worth seeing, I have to tell him to look over there.


I realized through conversations with my father that this was the only way to change his dream. That realization led directly to action.


“Father, will you make a promise with me?”


Not only my father, but also the Amazons looked at me with curious expressions. I continued speaking while everyone was paying attention.


“Yes, it is a promise between a man and a man. It is a promise between a leader and a sub-leader, and also a promise between a father and a son.”


“What kind of promise?”


“Give me some time.”


“Time?”


I thought about how many years it would take. It needed to be neither too short nor too long.


It’s time to achieve your goal.


“Please give me exactly five years from now.”

“If you give it to me?”


“I will ask you again then. If even then, your dream is to unify the martial arts world, then I will stand at the forefront of that war.”


“!”


Both his father and Ma-Jon were shocked. Chu-Ma looked like he wanted to shout, “No! What are you doing?” at any moment.


The two eyes of the evil soma on the other side were smiling. Did he imagine me standing side by side with him in the vanguard?


My decision to stand at the forefront of the war was my decisive move.


Within five years, I will eliminate all of the Hwamoogi gang, and within five years, I will change my father’s mind. Within that time, I will definitely give my father a new dream.


Five years.


War is not something that can be waged immediately.


Depending on what strategy you choose to use to prepare for a war, it could take anywhere from a few months to as long as two or three years.


In that case, five years is not such a long time for my father.


If you win this bet, you can get me.


I have achieved the Twelve Great Stars of the Nine Flower Demonic Arts using the Shicheon Secret Art, right?


How can I be the only one to get it? I can get everything I have achieved so far as a bonus. If I take the lead and help, my father’s dream of unifying the martial arts world will come closer.


This promise is a formal promise made in front of the Amazons.


“I am making a promise to you right now, with my life at stake.”


“Won’t you regret it?”


“Wouldn’t your father have regrets?”


Our eyes met in the air. Everyone here knew that these two people would definitely keep their promises. That was why both my father and I had to make a careful decision.


“Why five years?”




“It’s not about changing someone else’s heart, it’s about changing my father’s heart. If it were up to me, I would like to do it in fifty years.”


“This is a fight where I just have to keep this feeling. Five years will pass quickly. Are you still going to do it?”


“In the meantime, I will definitely change my father’s mind.”


A smirk formed on my father’s lips. That smirk, which gave off a different feeling each time, was filled with joy today. It felt as if he was asking, ‘Actually, you want to fight too, right?’


That must have been why. My father nodded readily.


“Okay. I’ll take that promise.”


I reaffirmed this bet that would change everyone’s fate with the Amazons.


“Five years later, on this day, I will once again invite all the demons here and ask about my father’s dream. Let’s see what happens that day.”


Five years later, my father’s dream will be different. He will tell a dream that will surprise all the Amazons here. I will make sure that happens.


“Thank you, Father.”


The Amazons all looked at me and my father with expressions of surprise at this unexpected result.


Now I asked my father with an easy mind.


“Now that it’s all over, I have a question for you. When you met with the demons, were you preparing to unify the martial arts world?”


But unexpectedly, my father shook his head.


“No, you said not?”


He is not the type of person to lie when asked such a question. I asked again in surprise.


“Then why did you meet all the Amazons?”


“You all met?”


“Meet Soma-nim, have a drink with Chuma-nim, and help the Poison King make poison.”


“Aren’t there just those three?”




That’s right. There were three Amazons I met in person. And even they gave different reasons.


“I heard that they brought furniture into Soma’s room. That’s why I went to check it out.”


If that’s really the case, then my father must have had a change of heart recently.


“I just drank with Chwima because the wine from the Ice Palace Holy Grail was so delicious.”


“What about the Poison King?”


“I heard that they needed a sophisticated hollow-body water. They had failed several times in making it because they didn’t have such an assistant. That’s why I went to help.”


I looked at my father. I couldn’t tell if he was being sincere or not.


“I only met three, but you met them all.”


“!”


I asked my father with a startled expression.


“Then why did you all gather here today? Wasn’t it to persuade me and unite the demons?”


“no.”


“No?”


“Is this the kind of kid that you can persuade to change his mind?”


Yeah, there’s no way my father doesn’t know about me.


“I heard reports that you’ve been meeting with all the demons. I’ve been going around trying to persuade them, but I feel like I need to wrap things up.”


In other words, it was a place for me.


“Huh? Then why did I make a five-year promise?”


“You brought it up first. I didn’t say anything.”


In fact, my father has not yet directly told me what his dream is.




I shouted at the bloodthirsty demon as if I was questioning him.


“My father said that maybe this is the moment when he starts to move in earnest to make his dream come true!”


“… … I said that might be the case.”


Next, to Kwonma.


“I heard your father is already at war?”


“Wouldn’t a father who has a son like you always be at war?”


“Is that what you meant?”


“What else could it mean?”


And to Mabul too.


“Did your father create this stage?”


The brightly shining light of the Buddha has faded.


“Did I do that? I’ve been out of my mind lately. I guess I should go finish making the stone statue I was making.”


I looked back and forth between my father and the demons.


“Right? This happened to me? It was all planned from the beginning, right?”


As I was clutching my head with a pained expression, the Poison King, who was standing far away, suddenly sent a telegram.


-The one who was hit was the leader.


He read my mind exactly.


―If war breaks out, you will be involved anyway. The person I know will ask the cult leader to take the lead. You will try to minimize the damage caused by war.


I looked back at him and smiled. He was right.


Should I close the temple because I hate war, or should I side with the Murim Alliance? If I can’t prevent it in advance, I’ll have to jump into the war.




I joked that I got hit, but it wasn’t a hit. Rather, it was a win-win situation for me.


At least we won’t have to worry about war for the next five years.


-Do you think the leader doesn’t know your true intentions?


-You know what?


I could tell just by looking at the way my father looked at me. It didn’t mean he was trying to look after me.


My father gave me a chance and told me to give it a try.


This is not a one-day match, but a grand match that will last for five long years.


The fate of the martial arts world hangs on this match.


By then, I will definitely achieve the Twelve Great Stars of the Nine Fire Demons and kill the Fire Weapon.


And we will fight together in a fight that is even more difficult than that fight.


To show my father that there is a better dream than Murimiltong. To walk with him and show him the scenery he has never seen before.


The empty throne.


The empty feeling that came to my mind now was not the scary feeling I had thought of before. It must be the absence of another reason.


Father, you will have to go here and there with me now, because I have an excuse.


My father spoke with a faint smile, not knowing whether he knew my feelings or not.


“If you become the vanguard, you will be strong.”
