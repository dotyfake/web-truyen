# Absolute Regression Chapter 175 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Dae-ryong ngồi trên giường nhìn nhân vật chính (Tôi) cởi quần áo và chuẩn bị cho trận chiến cuối cùng. Cậu đùa với Dae-ryong, nhưng Dae-ryong khẳng định sẽ không tham gia vào nguy hiểm nữa.

Trong khi đó, Cheon Myeong-hoe và Jo I-baek gặp nhau. Jo I-baek nhận xét Cheon Myeong-hui là một người bình thường đến mức khác thường. Cheon Myeong-hoe nói rằng Liên minh Murim (Murim Alliance) đã để ý đến việc con trai ông ta gia nhập nhóm. Jo I-baek hỏi về việc con trai mình bị giam trong ngục não (brain prison) và nhờ Cheon Myeong-hoe giúp đỡ.

Một cánh cửa mở ra và một thanh niên bước vào. Jo I-baek nghĩ rằng đó là lãnh đạo Liên minh Murim, nhưng thay vào đó lại là một người trẻ tuổi. Geommu-geuk nói rằng anh ta được lãnh đạo Liên minh Murim phái đến và tuyên bố giao dịch con trai của Cheon Myeong-hoe để đổi lấy ông ta. Jo I-baek lo sợ đây là một cái bẫy, cố gắng thuyết phục Cheon Myeong-hoe không tin và bí mật ra lệnh cho thuộc hạ bắt cóc Jin Ha-ryeong.

Geommu-geuk nói với Cheon Myeong-hoe rằng anh ta có tin tốt và tin xấu. Tin tốt là anh ta đến một mình. Tin xấu cũng là anh ta đến một mình, vì không ai có thể ngăn cản anh ta. Geommu-geuk yêu cầu Jo I-baek phải chọn phe. Jo I-baek thề trung thành với Cheon Myeong-hoe. Cheon Myeong-hoe tuyên bố sẽ giải quyết vấn đề này, và những cao thủ xuất hiện: Gu Ling, Yorai, và Gu Qiu, cùng với hàng trăm người đeo mặt nạ.

Jo I-baek ra lệnh cho Tứ quân tử (Four Gentlemen) của mình tấn công Geommu-geuk. Jo I-baek đề nghị hòa giải với Cheon Myeong-hoe, nhưng Geommu-geuk tuyên bố sẽ tiêu diệt tất cả những kẻ phản bội, bao gồm cả Cheon Myeong-hoe và Jinryongjangju (Jinryongjang Master). Mọi người cười nhạo sự ngông cuồng của Geommu-geuk.

Đột nhiên, Hắc Ma Kiếm (Black Magic Sword) bắt đầu khóc, tạo ra một tiếng vọng sâu thẳm từ vực thẳm.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-174/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-176/)Episode 175: I have good news and bad news.




I slowly took off my clothes while staring at my reflection in the mirror.


She took off everything except her underwear. A smooth body without an ounce of fat, honed through martial arts training.


I untied all the Extreme Heavenly Silk that I had wrapped around the hilt of the Black Demon Sword and carefully wrapped it around my heart, throat, dantian, and other vital points. Then, I put on the Gwihoi that the Blood Heavenly Sword Master had given me over it.


Seo Dae-ryong sat on the bed and watched me silently as I prepared for the final battle.


At times like this, I felt sad that I had to leave out the jokes, so I threw a joke at Seo Dae-ryong.


“We’ll go and fight together, won’t we?”


“I won’t do it. The biggest adventure of my life is already over. I won the Little Dragon Championship! I’ll live my whole life bragging about it like a scorpion. There’s no more danger in my life.”


I spoke to him, wearing light and comfortable clothes.


“As you go higher, your mind will change! You will throw yourself into life-or-death danger. You will find joy in it, and you will seek greater danger.”


“Don’t make such strange predictions!”




Seo Dae-ryong stuck his head out the window, looked up at the sky and said.


“Just pretend you didn’t hear that! No, no. My adventures are over. I have enough stories to tell my grandchildren as they sit on my lap.”


I can’t help but joke around with you since you’re reacting so enthusiastically.


“Take care on your way.”


“Mysterious organizations are dangerous only when they are mysterious, but when they are revealed, they are even more worthless. Don’t worry.”


“No matter how much you say that, I won’t follow you.”


“It doesn’t work.”


I know. How much that Seodaeryong cares about me right now. How much he wants to fight with me. The burning heat in his eyes is telling me to wait. Until he becomes stronger.


\* \* \*


Cheon Myeong-hoe and Jo I-baek sat facing each other in Jang-won’s pavilion.




“How have you been?”


“Thanks to you, I had a good time.”


Joy Baek met Cheon Myeong-hui several times. Cheon Myeong-hui did not act like a secretive person. He would come to him when he needed something, and when he wanted to meet him, he would call him like this.


Cheonmyeonghoeju’s martial arts skills were far superior to his own. However, after taking those martial arts skills out of the equation, his impression was surprisingly ‘ordinary’.


The word ordinary is not a suitable expression for the leader of the underworld, but he was certainly ordinary.


When I turned around while eating at the inn, I saw a face that looked like it was normal for someone to sit next to me and eat, and his manner of speaking and behavior were also normal.


Because he was an ordinary person who should not have been ordinary, he felt extraordinary. He was the kind of person who could hide behind a dark curtain because he was so ordinary.


“Why did you ask to see me today?”


“There’s a problem.”


“Please tell me.”




“The Murim Alliance noticed that my son had entered the group.”


Joy Baek stared at Cheonmyeonghoeju and asked additional questions.


“When did my son enroll?”


Although it was a situation where he should have been angry, Joyback asked calmly.


“Did your son join too?”


Then, Cheonmyeonghoeju responded that he did not know.


“I didn’t know.”


It seemed so natural that he really didn’t know, but Joyback didn’t believe it.


In a situation where the owner of Jinryongjang had recruited himself, he didn’t know that his son, the successor, had been recruited? If it was such a sloppy organization, it would be wise to get out as soon as possible.


Joy Baek didn’t bother to ask for the obvious. He didn’t have time to have an emotional fight with Cheon Myeong-hoe-ju. Today was the day he had to walk the tightrope, the most dangerous and important tightrope in his life.


“My son is currently locked in a brain prison. I came to see the Lord and asked him to find a way out.”


“You couldn’t have locked him up in a brain prison just because he was related to the company.”


“I am accused of falling for their scheme and attempting to kidnap the leader’s granddaughter.”


“Oh my! Anyway, that’s what those shameless Murim Alliance guys do.”


Cheonmyeonghoeju clicked his tongue and shook his head.


“How can there be a way?”


“Isn’t Jo Jang-ju close to the leader of the martial arts world?”


“Doesn’t the leader cherish his granddaughter so much? I don’t think this matter can be resolved through friendship alone.”


“Okay, I understand. I’ll think about what to do.”


“thank you.”




Just then, a door in the distance opened.


If you were to pick the most trembling moment in Joy Baek’s life, it would probably be this moment.


I naturally thought he was the leader of the martial arts world, but the person who entered was actually a young man.


‘The leader hasn’t come?’


Since the leader didn’t come, he naturally didn’t bring his son.


‘why?’


You wanted the Cheonmyeonghoeju so badly?


‘What are you trying to do?’


Of course, the trick was to use him too.


This was a plan in case the leader of the clan did not want to release his son after dealing with Cheonmyeonghoeju, or even tried to imprison him. He had prepared a master who would actually kidnap Jin Ha-ryeong.


But this was not expected. Neither the leader nor his son came.


How should we react?


Joy Baek’s gaze turned to the young man walking towards him.


Since he is of noble status, the leader can send other masters instead of coming himself. But why send only one young master like that?


‘Really? Is this young man a master who can take on Cheonmyeonghoeju?’

That can’t be. He must have come to convey some message from the leader.


No one stopped Geommu-geuk as he walked towards them. Cheonmyeonghoeju and Jo I-baek had not given any orders.


As Geommugeuk joined the two people at the table where they were sitting, Cheonmyeonghoeju asked Joybaek.


“Who is this thief?”


Cheonmyeonghoeju thought that Geommugeuk, who had walked towards them so calmly and confidently, was naturally one of Joy Baek’s subordinates.


Then Joy Baek pretended not to know and asked.


“Wasn’t that the person you brought?”


Geommugeuk said calmly.


“I am a person sent by the leader of the martial arts world.”


For a moment, Cheonmyeonghoeju was startled.


The air around him had changed. Geommugeuk felt those hiding around him busily moving about.


“Since we have an honored guest, I will take my leave now. Please let us talk.”


The moment when Cheonmyeonghoeju naturally greeted and was about to get up from his seat.


“Please sit down, Cheonmyeonghoeju.”


“!”


Cheonmyeonghoeju stared at the sword dance for a while before sitting down again.


“You came knowing I was here.”


Cheonmyeonghoeju’s gaze turned to Joy Baek. Joy Baek slightly shook his head and denied the fact.


Cheonmyeonghoeju asked.


“Why did the leader send the messenger?”




“Here, the chief of the household negotiated a deal. He agreed to trade his son for the household.”


Joy Baek was flustered because he didn’t know he would say something so openly. On the other hand, Cheon Myeong-hoe-ju didn’t get angry at Joy Baek because he thought it was natural.


Joy Baek strongly denied it.


“Don’t believe it. It’s the leader’s trick to sow discord between us.”


Joy Baek had to hold on tenaciously until he found out why the leader had sent this young man in his place.


Of course, it wasn’t an easy choice as long as there was a sword play.


“Don’t blame Jo Jang-ju too much. It must not have been an easy decision, considering the matter of his children.”


“I understand.”


Cheonmyeonghoeju nodded.


Joy Baek denied it to the end.


“Don’t be fooled. Don’t be fooled by their tricks.”


Joy Baek couldn’t help but misunderstand. He thought that the leader of the martial arts world was trying to eliminate him through the Cheonmyeonghoeju. That’s why Joy Baek was so angry.


‘You’re saying that you came out like this?’


Joy Baek secretly sent a message to his subordinate who was hiding.


-Tell them to proceed to Jinharyeong. Right now!


-yes.


He decided that he could only survive if he got his hands on Jinharyeong as quickly as possible.


But he didn’t know that the reason the Murim leader didn’t come here was because he had accepted Geommu-geuk’s advice to protect Jinharyeong.


Geommugeuk asked Cheonmyeonghoeju.


“I have good news and bad news for you. Which one would you like to hear first?”




“I like to start everything off on a good note, so let’s start with the good news.”


“I came alone.”


“Did you really come alone?”


Cheonmyeonghoeju was shocked. He thought that the masters of the Murim Alliance would be setting up camp outside.


“So what’s the bad news?”


“I came alone.”


When Geommugeuk repeated what he had said before, Cheonmyeonghoeju made a puzzled expression.


“Why is that bad news? Didn’t you say it was good news a little while ago?”


“It’s bad news, too, because there’s no one to stop me.”


Although he was speaking with confidence and even madness, Cheonmyeonghoeju seemed to be in a good mood.


“It’s not easy to find young people with such spirit these days, is it, Jangju Cho?”


“That’s right. Not only the newbies, but also the experienced veterans are all busy taking care of themselves.”


Even as I clapped my hands together like that, I still had doubts.


‘Are you really a master who can kill Cheonmyeonghoeju? Is that why you say such things?’


Should I join the Murim Alliance even now? Since I owe him the title of Cheonmyeonghoeju, I think I can somehow handle the situation.


Geommugeuk said to Joybaek, “Have you read that conflict?”


“Cho Jang-ju, I think it’s time to make it clear which side you’re on.”


Joy Baek was really conflicted. However, no matter how much he thought about it, he couldn’t believe that this young man could kill Cheonmyeonghoeju. If the leader of the martial arts world was here, then it would be different, but the person close by right now was Cheonmyeonghoeju.


“What are you talking about? I have never betrayed you, Lord, even for a single moment.”


“Can I take that as your official position?”




It was a saying that contained the meaning that there was nothing one could do even if one was executed.


Joy Baek was caught up in a conflict. He had not expected why the leader of the martial arts world would act like this, so the decision was not easy.


At that time, Cheon Myeong-hoe said with a smile.


“I will solve our captain’s problem.”


The moment his words fell, people appeared from all directions.


Just looking at that first person was enough to make Joy Baek’s heart sink.


The man with the short straight sword on his waist was Gu Ling, the Demon Sword. He was once the best swordsman in the Jeongpa sect and was known as one of the three great masters of Taoism.


Even the thousand-year-old’s ceremonial rites are a real feast.


These two alone would have made my heart sink, but there were others too.


There was a monk who appeared wearing a robe and holding a large iron staff in his hand. He was the supreme monk Yorai, who was active as an absolute master of the Western Dharma.


It was hard to think of anyone who could handle these two people, but then a hunchbacked old man with a peculiar demeanor appeared at the end.


The worn-out green pouch hanging from his waist gave away who he was. He was the great poisoner, Gu Qiu. He was known for his mastery of poison, so much so that wherever he walked, not a single blade of grass could survive and it would become a land of eternal death. Everyone who knew him was afraid of him.


But it wasn’t those three masters who completely changed the atmosphere here.


Masked people appeared from all directions. Countless masked people appeared from unknown places, just like ants rushing out of an anthill.


They filled the surroundings like that. From under the wall to above the wall, in the yard and on the roof. There must have been at least a hundred of them. They weren’t just the number of people. The eyes and the spirit above the masks were fierce and sharp.


Joy Baek just found out. Cheonmyeonghoeju brings along such great masters.


‘It’s really incredible. Even if I wanted to catch Cheonmyeonghoeju, I would never be able to.’


There was no point in worrying any further.


When Joyback sent a signal, four people appeared there.


Their attire included military uniforms with patterns of plum blossoms, orchids, chrysanthemums, and bamboo, and they were the Four Gentlemen of Joy Baek.




“We’ll take care of that kid.”


If you want to be forgiven for this, you have to make it clear that someone on your side has to step up and eliminate the author.


Joy Baek spoke frankly to Cheon Myeong-hoe.


“How about we forget our past mistakes as men? Didn’t you bring my son in without me knowing in the first place? Let’s just forget each other.”


“Okay. They say the ground hardens after it rains.”


The two people looked at each other and laughed.


Then Geommugeuk said.


“After you kill me, you will kill me. I cannot let a traitor live.”


“Young man! Stop causing trouble.”


Once Joy Baek made up his mind, he never looked back.


“You will never make it out of here alive. Even your leader will not survive.”


“I was honestly worried that you would take my side.”


“What does that mean?”


“I made up my mind to kill you too, but if you take my side, wouldn’t I feel bad when I kill you?”


“You’re saying something like that even in this situation? You’re truly a madman.”


Joy Baek gave an order to the Four Gentlemen.


“Kill him.”


The four gentlemen stepped out into the open space.


Geommugeuk also walked slowly and stood in front of them.


There were over a hundred masked masters surrounding them without a single gap, and the absolute masters, Chammado, Paeseung, and Daedokno, as well as Jinryongjangju and Cheonmyeonghoeju, were watching them.


Geommugeuk stared at the Cheonmyeonghoeju within the huge mass and spoke calmly.


“You impersonated the evil Soma to plunder the lives and wealth of the martial arts people, and you plotted to overthrow the Murim Alliance by marrying the leader’s granddaughter. Therefore, you and everyone else, including the Cheonmyeonghoeju and Jinryongjangju, will be executed on the spot.”


There was a moment of silence.


But soon someone couldn’t hold it in and burst out laughing, and from there, the laughter spread to everyone. No one in the room was nervous or scared. Yes, he must be a master. He must be confident in his skills, so he would say something like that.


However, they were a force that wouldn’t be strange if they were to invade the Murim Alliance right away. That’s why everyone was just enjoying the madness of a child who couldn’t tell the difference between heaven and earth.


Just at that moment when the murmurs and laughter were growing louder, everyone seemed to be told to be quiet.


Woooooooooooooo!


With a deep echo from the abyss, the black magic sword began to cry on its own.
