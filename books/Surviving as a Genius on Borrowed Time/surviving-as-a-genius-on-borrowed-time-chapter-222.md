# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 222 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Ma Gwang-ik (Ma Gwang-ik) phô diễn sức mạnh võ thuật tại thao trường rộng lớn của Iphwangseong (Ip Hwang Seong), nơi các cao thủ đang luyện tập. Các thành viên thảo luận về sự xáo trộn ở Wonpyeongilgeomjang (Wonpyeong Ilgeomjang) và lo lắng về sự an toàn của chủ nhân, nhưng tin rằng với sự bảo vệ nghiêm ngặt, không ai có thể xâm nhập.

Baek Mi-ryeo, cùng với Wi Ye-ryeong, quan sát thao trường. Wi Ye-ryeong trêu chọc về việc Baek Mi-ryeo quan tâm đến Ma Gwang-ik, nhưng cô phủ nhận. Baek Mi-ryeo trầm ngâm suy nghĩ về lời khuyên của lãnh đạo tiền nhiệm về việc phát triển Seomye (Seomye), và cách tổ chức đội hình của Ma Gwang-ik.

Các cao thủ khác bàn tán về việc kết hợp giữa phong cách chiến đấu thực tế của Ma Gwang-ik với Mu-Maek (Mu-Maek) của Seomye là rất khó. Cheongmyeong (Cheongmyeong) nằm dài trên tường, lẩm bẩm về việc nếu không giải quyết được vấn đề này, việc thu nhận nhiều thành viên mới sẽ vô ích. Hyosu-geom Kang Chang-mu (Kang Chang-mu) tỏ vẻ khó chịu, và Tae-yeon-ryong (Tae-yeon-ryong) chế giễu kỹ năng kiếm thuật của anh ta, khiến Kang Chang-mu nổi giận.

Trong khi đó, Jeong Yeon-shin (Jeong Yeon-shin) xấu hổ rời khỏi Wonpyeongilgeomjang và đến Iphwangsin House (Iphwangsin House), nơi cô được tiếp đón trọng thị. Cô tìm gặp Shin Seol-ha (Shin Seol-ha) để hỏi về Shin So-bin (Shin So-bin). Jeong Yeon-shin ngồi đối diện Shin Seol-ha, bày tỏ mong muốn được biết thêm thông tin về Shin So-bin.

Shin Seol-ha giải thích rằng cô đã đưa Shin So-bin ra khỏi Shingeomdan (Shingeomdan) vì muốn con gái tập trung vào võ thuật phù hợp với gia tộc Shin, Jecheonmugyeong (Jecheonmugyeong). Jeong Yeon-shin phản bác rằng Shin So-bin là một "chim ưng" và có quyền lựa chọn con đường của riêng mình. Hai người tranh cãi gay gắt, với việc Shin Seol-ha khẳng định quyền lực của mình.

Đột nhiên, trần nhà sụp đổ, và Mayeonjeok (Mayeonjeok), ông nội của Jeong Yeon-shin, xuất hiện và tấn công Shin Seol-ha bằng một đòn sét "Không đáng kể". Shin Seol-ha bất tỉnh ngay lập tức. Jeong Yeon-shin kinh ngạc gọi "Ông nội!", nhưng Mayeonjeok hỏi lại một cách chậm rãi. Jeong Yeon-shin nhận ra sai lầm của mình và trách móc ông nội đã can thiệp. Mayeonjeok nhanh chóng xin lỗi và hứa sẽ không tái phạm. Ông ta biến mất, để lại Jeong Yeon-shin một mình với Shin Seol-ha bất tỉnh và sự hỗn loạn đang diễn ra. Jeong Yeon-shin bình tĩnh nghĩ "Tôi đoán tôi nên thuận theo dòng chảy".

Ma Gwang-ik’s great martial arts performance.


In a space large enough to accommodate at least five hundred men, a variety of weapons were lined up on marble stands.


The vast ground was extremely hardened. It had endured countless awakenings.


Swish! Pfft!


All sorts of unarmed men were wielding their weapons. Sharp blasts of light were continuously emitted through the disorderly ranks.


It was a powerful position for both men and women. It was a place where there was no one who was not a master.


“I heard there was chaos at Wonpyeongilgeomjang?”


“I heard there was a lightning strike during the day. I’m worried about your safety. I’m talking about our lord.”


“Arthur. Do you have anything to worry about in black?”


“I wonder if the middle-aged major shareholders will foolishly do it on their own. If they can withstand the punishment of heaven with the black ones’ self-defense skills, it wouldn’t be strange. Even if I’m not good at studying, I’ll be able to raise my True Energy Shield the moment I make up my mind.”




“Our Grand Master is a little uneasy, but… … If he had that feeling, he would have responded somehow. He also has his seniors. In the first place, wasn’t Wonpyeong Ilgeomjang protected by the secret formation of the famous clans?”


“What if it’s not lightning, but an intruder?”


“That’s his misfortune. There are currently six Daejus in Wonpyeongilgeomjang. The Grand General’s internal studies have also reached Samhwachwijeong, so it’s safe to say there are at least seven. It’s rare for so many to gather. Isn’t this the most dangerous place in the world?”


“If it was really something big, the lord would have appeared.”


“The bell didn’t even ring. Let’s focus again.”


The atmosphere was free and neat. It was like that from the nameless and clean-white uniforms they wore.


The hems of the clothes fluttering in an antique manner were smoothly ironed, but none of them looked like the clothing of a warrior.


Ironing. The servants were concerned about their appearance. It was a sight that proved the power of the emperor.


“You have to get out from there by moving to the rear.”


“How about switching? Your light wave is strong, but it doesn’t seem to be as good as a quick sword as a preemptive strike.”




There were many who were in sync in preparation for a group battle. They stayed close together and practiced their skills.


Some people stood on the rooftop with their arms folded, while others sat down far away and had breakfast.


No one cared about the injury. They just secretly looked around and kept a close watch.


“Ma Gwang-ik’s style is free-spirited.”


A woman wearing a sleeveless blue robe said.


He had ears that stood out like swords. He looked dignified with his arms crossed in a calm manner.


As an archer, the trapezius muscles below the neck form graceful curves.


He was an archery expert who supported the rear of Seonmokryeong as the commander of the Sawolgunggwi Wiyeoryeong. His affiliation changed after Cheon Soso’s defeat in the Battle of Bimu.


Baek Mi-ryeo, standing next to him, roughly brushed back the jet-black hair behind her ears.


“The disposition of the armed forces depends on the leader. It is because they did not go on missions with the new leader. Now that the junior has become the leader, neither side knows what to do. Discipline will be restored soon.”




“It seems that Ilryeongeommae cares a lot for the young lord.”


Wi Ye-ryeong said. The smile on her lips was like a hazy crescent moon.


Baek Mi-ryeo glanced at her and turned her head again. Then she absentmindedly opened her lips.


“That’s a ridiculous story. The Lord is sparing me. And… … .”


The corners of Baek Mi-ryeo’s lips slightly lowered.


“Young master. Don’t let me hear the same words again. It’s an annoying expression. Your bow, isn’t it made of precious ebony? It would be a shame if it were to break.”


“I made a slip of the tongue.”


Wi Ye-ryeong’s smile deepened.


That was it.


He is not pushed back in a fight. He is of noble bloodline and belongs to the rank of blue-clothed people.


Even if the Ilryeongeommae and the Cheonganmagyeom were considered the strongest blue swordsman, they were not greatly inferior.


The elite masters of Ip Hwang Seong.


He is equipped with blue weapons in the vast land, which means that it is practically difficult to find an opponent.


The upper echelons of martial arts, such as the Apostles’ Thirteen Heavenly Sect, the Nine Factions, and the Eight Factions, are only a very small number.


If you are an elite member of the Great Wave, you are bound to have a distinct personality and high self-esteem.


Baek Mi-ryeo didn’t say anything else. It was Dae-ju’s job to take care of it. It was Jeong Yeon-shin’s job.


The new mid-level rookies from Seonmokryeong, Bohyuldae, and Cheonrimdae, as well as the expert Ma Gwangik, will maintain order under Seomye’s Bukmyeonggeom. It’s just a matter of time.


Each of us has our own challenges. Baek Mi-ryeo was one of them.


‘If Seomyeo can breathe a little easier… …then I should seriously think about the words of the previous leader.’


She looked thoughtful with sunken eyes.




―Is Baek Mi-ryeo, the one who mastered the real Cheonma Shin-gyeol alone? That is no reason to keep Seomye away. He is the future of Iphwangseong in name and reality. I don’t know what other people who haven’t seen Seomye think, but there is no reason to disparage his words as advice from a lowly person. I have never heard of such qualities.


The story of the margin has been an old puzzle, a topic worth thinking about, and has made me watch the island for a long time.


Now that he has become the leader and is leading a force close to the family, Baek Mi-ryeo has come to fully respect him as her superior.


It’s not something that can be a burden.


I had to figure out how to organize the bowl by looking at the way the Magwangik was organized.


After that, she planned to seek help, but only from her master, on the premise of complete disclosure of the secret.


The silence was brief. There were many noble warriors.


“What a thief. I heard that a properly polished magic sword is quite a threat.”


“It is a thorough practical martial art. It is close to the senses.”


“It’ll be hard to combine them. The Somye Mu-maek and the Magwang-gyeol… … Both are ascending martial arts, so you have to focus completely on one. If you learn them half-heartedly, you’ll end up being neither one nor the other.”


“It wasn’t unexpected. It just feels more real now that I’ve seen it. That’s why moving the military was frowned upon.”


The masters who had moved to another affiliation spoke with embarrassment. There were six blue masters and two white masters. They were watching the training of the Ma Gwang-ik masters.


He turned his back on the martial arts he had accumulated and took up the art of island craftsmanship.


It was okay once. It was bearable even if it went beyond supporting the main martial arts and reached the level of replacing the main martial arts. Even if the training was difficult, it was their choice.


The Mu-Maek is similar to the principles of the Mu-Hak that I have been pursuing, but is at a higher level. The more I learned about it, the more enjoyable the training became.

However, Magwanggyeol was another problem.


The power to transform Ma Gwang-ik into a single sword when facing a group battle.


The personality of Touro is the same. He sees the enemy’s weaknesses in the same way and makes similar decisions as his colleagues. As a result, he has been annihilating his enemies with a trajectory that leaves no room for defense.


The utility of the combined attack was enormous. Magwanggyeol was such a martial art. That is why Magwangik is often compared to the plum blossom swordsmen.


Even though there was no such thing as a plum blossom inspection, they showed their equal power in group battles.


“If I can’t solve this, then absorbing so many blues will be for nothing. I’ll have to send you on a solo mission.”


Cheongmyeong muttered, lying on the wall next to them.


The hustle and bustle continued. No one interrupted Cheong An Ma Geom’s monologue.


It was nothing new, and it wasn’t a task. It was just a natural thing.


“The thrill of galloping through the wilderness with your comrades is immense. The joy of sweeping away enemies together is diminished, isn’t that what you expected? I want to seek some guidance, but the Lord doesn’t show himself at all.”


Hyosu-geom Kang Chang-mu said rudely.


He was a swordsman from Cheonrimdae. He was as big as the Cheon Kwon Yong Ryuk Shin, who was originally enshrined as the Great Lord. The same was true of the sword armor he wore on his back.


A thick and overwhelming prayer was rising from his entire body. If the momentum he was constantly exerting was like that, it meant that his accumulated energy was enormous.


“Well, with your level of intelligence (thinking ability), that’s probably the limit anyway.”


A young man in casual clothes passed him by and spoke, his arms resting on the back of his head.


The way he chews on blades of grass with his mouth is no different from that of a back alley thug.


“I see you have mastered the Gwanghwageom style of swordsmanship in a half-hearted manner. What a pity.”


“what?”


“That’s just how it looks on the surface, but in reality it’s a swordsmanship that’s been put together with absolutely no consideration. I think it’ll get stuck at the composition stage. It’ll be hard to develop the swordsmanship with just a little sense.”


The shadowed eyes looked languid. Tae-yeon-ryong only pointed to Wi-ye-ryeong with a nod.




It was a behavior that was also passed down to Nilecheon from the Blood Corps.


The way he wiggled his eyebrows was very aristocratic, and he gave off the feeling of being the head of a powerful clan that ruled the Jinan region.


“You too, you too. The Hwanikbo and Shigeukgyeong aren’t something that just anyone can mess with. Who wouldn’t know if they were someone like me?”


The nameless disciple of Ma Gwang-ik was waiting for the day of his death. He could not bear the sight that was so unpleasant to his eyes.


This was especially true when it came to matters directly related to the martial arts of Magwangikju. It was because it was the world of martial arts that had been the last interest of his life.


Tae-Yeon-Ryong thought. These bastards, they don’t even know the topic.


“You’re the scoundrel of the Hwangbo family. I’ve heard a lot about you.”


Kang Chang-moo’s temperament resembles Cheonrimdaeju. I didn’t say anything more.


The punishment for insubordination is not a violation of the laws of the Imperial Family. He took off the armor on his back and immediately drew his great sword.


An incident occurred.


\* \* \*


Jeong Yeon-shin ran away from Wonpyeongilgeomjang.


Even when his grandfather called him loudly, he didn’t look back. He just walked straight across the street to Iphwangseong.


The shame I had to overcome with every step was immense. Before I knew it, I realized belatedly that I was crossing the threshold of the Iphwangsin House.


The gray gate was very large, comparable to the Ip Hwang Ma Ga.


Even the trees that spread out inside were beautifully landscaped. The red petals of the winter orchids that were blooming here and there licked the sunlight.


“The Lord Magwangik himself… …!”


The gatekeepers were terrified.


Jeongyeonshin held several ceremonies of her true nature. They were all open to the public according to the ceremony.


From the coming of age ceremony and the blue and black promotions to the duel with the Sunmok Ryeongju.




It became rare for people in the province to not know each other’s faces. This was true regardless of the size of the province.


“Please wait a moment!”


He was treated with the utmost courtesy. He was even given the title of guide by the Blue Sword. He was called the Nanming Sword and the Shinbaek Sword.


It was accompanied by an introduction that he was Shin So-bin’s cousin.


Shin So-bin is Jeong Yeon-shin’s subordinate. Even though she comes from a prestigious family and possesses rare qualities, this fact remains unchanged.


If he had not become a monk, I would not have known, but as a member of Ma Gwang-ik, he was in Jeong Yeon-shin’s arms.


Iphwangsin-ga also couldn’t help but think about Ma Gwang-ik-ju’s feelings.


‘It is right for Sobin to be under my protection. I can take her as my lord. But more than that… … .’


How will she face her black seniors in the future? Jeong Yeon-shin’s heart dug endlessly downward.


There was an abyss within the abyss. The voice leaking out between the lips naturally subsided.


“Guide to the owner.”


The masters of the new house flinched. There was no one in their hall who could withstand the wrath of the black master.


The elder lord was exhausted and the exiled lord was out on a mission.


No one dared to look at Magwangikju properly, even though the new lord was famous for his upright character.


In the still atmosphere, Ma Gwang-ik-ju, whose bare left sleeve was impressive, entered the arena.


Shin Seol-ha was waiting at the top seat. She was sitting with her back straight.


His seated appearance exuded dignity.


“Please forgive my indebtedness for not showing up even after entrusting my daughter to you. I was so busy with my family business that I couldn’t meet with Magwangikju.”


“I would like to receive information about Shin So-bin.”


Jeong Yeon-shin said, sitting with a neat posture.




His words and actions do not go against the hierarchy of the black masters of the Shingeomdan.


The only ones who can stand on top of the Great Lord of Iphwangseong are the Purple Masters and the Lord of the Castle. It was something that the head of the family under the main castle could not say anything about.


Even so, there was something natural about the new leader Ma Gwang-ik’s conduct. He was very proud.


A new look appeared in Shin Seol-ha’s eyes.


“It’s a big deal. They say that the martial arts skills of the island’s most talented people are like that. I told my servant to prepare the dragon’s spirit, but it was in vain. It was just precious tea leaves.”


“The agenda is too heavy to drink tea. If you had respected the great master you saw, you wouldn’t have treated him poorly. You took out a master from the Shingumdan without the great master’s permission. It’s something that can be dealt with as a subordinate position immediately.”


Jeongyeonshin spoke quietly. Shinseolha’s eyebrows twitched.


“I have already respected you to no end. I should do the same just by looking at the achievements you have made so far. However, as Sobin’s mother, I beg you, could you please listen to my story even just a little?”


“Speak.”


“The problem was my daughter’s martial arts. She was too strict. I mean, the martial arts master. There was an outstanding scholar named Jecheonmugyeong in my family.”


Shin Seol-ha said, straightening the sleeves of her orange clothes. Her clear voice reminded me of Shin So-bin.


“Just because a crow sharpens its talons like a bird of prey, it cannot be like an eagle. It is a separate matter from your outstanding qualities. The martial arts of Jeong Dae-ju are suitable only for Jeong Dae-ju. The Jecheon Martial Arts are martial arts suited to the Shin clan. So-bin has her own duties. Raising the family’s reputation… … It is a duty that the direct line of a noble family must shoulder.”


“You look down on your daughter. Sobin is a bird of prey.”


“Then, the words of the head of the household are even more powerful. Even if you learn the Jecheonmu Kyung, you are still a child who will become black. The words of the head of the household do not reach me.”


Shin Seol-ha concluded her speech with a firm mouth.


He has already made up his mind and is facing Jeongyeonshin. The duty of blood relatives and the authority of the great lord collide.


Silence flowed through the quiet house. The air was heavy and deep.


Jeong Yeon-shin absentmindedly thought of the Iphwangma.


The first meeting was not at all pleasant, and the logic was similar to that of Shin Seol-ha… … .


Kwaaaaang―!




Suddenly, the ceiling shattered. Before the sudden blow from above could even reach me, a pink lightning bolt rushed in like a divine punishment.


The roaring noise was incredibly intense. It was a terrifying sight.


It seemed as if the irresistible typhoon had transformed into a human form and was charging straight towards Shinseolha.


Before the question could even form on her face.


Oh my god!


The protective gear surrounding Shin Seol-ha’s body was shattered into pieces. It happened in an instant.


The belated headwind swept the colorless waves away like mirror fragments. The fragments of my career shimmered like dust in the sunlight.


Then her body fell backwards with a dull sound.


I could tell without even feeling his pulse. He was completely unconscious. It seemed like he barely escaped instant death.


“Something trivial.”


A man in his thirties spoke with a cold face. He was standing at Shinseolha’s bedside.


The sight of her suddenly appearing and flapping her pink sleeves was very mysterious.


Jeongyeonshin couldn’t stand it any longer.


“grandfather!”


The head of the traitor turned right away.


“grandfather……?”


The young man asked back. It was a rather slow question.


Jeongyeonshin realized her mistake. She slowly took a deep breath and opened her mouth as if pretending to be calm.


“If you interfere when Soson acts as the head of the household, it will actually hurt my reputation. You did the same thing at Wonpyeongilgeomjang. I couldn’t tell you how difficult it was… I hope it doesn’t happen again.”


“… … Yes, I see. That’s right. You’re right.”


He was quick to agree. His grandfather’s words continued immediately.


“It was Grandfather’s fault. I’m so sorry. I didn’t realize it. It was because Grandfather was too impatient. Your enlightenment brought shame to Grandfather.”


Mayeonjeok was smiling. His mood seemed to have improved greatly. With an expression he had never seen before, his lips rose in a large curve.


“From now on, this old man will think twice or thrice about it. Please forgive me.”


At the same time, the new form of the magician disappeared. Only the kind voice remained, and after a while, it gradually faded away.


It rose up with a peerless spirit. The sound of it rushed upward endlessly. It was a realm of emptiness and emptiness.


“… … .”


Jeongyeonshin slowly lowered her head.


I looked down at the Iphwangsin family. There was no sign of them getting up. Outside, the family members who had belatedly realized the commotion were making a fuss.


It was just that I didn’t dare to intrude because of the heavy weight of the black name. But it wouldn’t last long.


The sound of weapons being pulled out could be heard here and there. A cool texture came through the cracks in the door along with the winter wind.


‘I guess I should just go with the flow.’


The new leader, Ma Gwang-ik, thought calmly.
