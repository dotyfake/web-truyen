 Chapter 115 – Disciple Scramble (2)


 At this distance, when infusing internal energy into sound, it was difficult to discern who had spoken and pinpoint their location.


 However, surprisingly, Mok Gyeong-un had found her after just two attempts.


 A mere brat who had merely reached the Peak Realm possessed such keen perception?


 Hang Yeo-ryang, the Valley Master of the Summoning Sound Valley, clicked her tongue and smacked her lips.


 A strong sense of desire arose within her.


 ‘How can I concede something like this?’


 Even if most of the leaders were after him, she had no intention of yielding whatsoever.


 No, their opinions didn’t matter anyway.


 There was only one thing to consider.


 It was a matter of successfully enticing Mok Gyeong-un.


 Hang Yeo-ryang looked at Mok Gyeong-un and spoke again, infusing internal energy into her voice.


 -Hehehe. You’re quite something. To find me instantly like that.


 

 At her words, Mok Gyeong-un’s eyes narrowed.


 He had simply looked at the center of the rippling energy waves, and his guess had been correct.


 However, how did she do it?


 ‘Without moving her lips?’


 The sound was echoing in his ears.


 As he was puzzled, Hang Yeo-ryang said to Mok Gyeong-un,


 -Why are you surprised?


 Rather than being surprised, he found it intriguing.


 The method of transmitting sound over such a distance using qi seemed quite useful.


 Should it be said that it appeared suitable for secretly speaking to someone?


 -Are you curious about how it’s done?


 There was no way he wouldn’t be curious.


 Mok Gyeong-un lightly nodded his head.

 -Shall I teach you?


 She suddenly offered to teach him this?


 Mok Gyeong-un looked at her with puzzlement.


 Mok Gyeong-un believed that everything had a corresponding price, so he thought there was no way that woman would teach him such a thing with pure intentions.


 ‘It’s quite fascinating, but not knowing it won’t cause any inconvenience.’


 With that, Mok Gyeong-un chuckled and turned his head away.


 Hang Yeo-ryang slightly furrowed her brows.


 She had tried to pique his interest, but she hadn’t expected him to refuse so readily.


 ‘…What an interesting kid.’


 She hadn’t demanded any compensation and had simply offered to teach him, yet this was the first time she had seen someone instantly end their displayed interest like that.


 Because of that, she became even more intrigued.


 Thus, she continued,


 -The essence of sound techniques is to create vibrations in the air through sound. This can be considered a similar principle.


 ‘!?’


 What was this?


 He hadn’t agreed to learn it, but as she explained the principle, one of Mok Gyeong-un’s eyebrows slightly raised.


 Regardless, Hang Yeo-ryang continued her explanation.


 -Imagine touching cotton with your qi between your vocal cords and the root of your tongue at the Yanquan acupoint[1], generating internal energy and quickly creating vibrations. And then…


 Even if he didn’t want to listen, the continuous sound made it impossible for him not to understand the method.


 Moreover, surprisingly, the method wasn’t very difficult.


 -A clever kid like you should be able to do it sufficiently with this level of explanation, right?


 At her words, Mok Gyeong-un slightly tilted his head to the side.


 Then, looking at Hang Yeo-ryang, he followed her instructions, sending internal energy to the Yanquan acupoint and tried it once.


 -Is this how it’s done?


 ‘Correct.’


 Upon hearing his voice, Hang Yeo-ryang slightly raised the corners of her mouth.


 He was indeed intelligent.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c50524a5a770dd7e4e350", id: "pf-8948-1"}) Even if the execution seemed easy, comprehending and performing it in one attempt was not a simple feat.


 He possessed the sharpness to grasp the principles that easily.


 ‘He’s a delightful child to teach.’


 At that moment, Mok Gyeong-un asked her,


 -It’s impressive. What is this technique called?


 -The monks of Shaolin refer to it as the ‘Intention-Sealing Voice Transmission’ (意闔傳聲), but the Valley Master and those who study sound techniques call it the ‘Secret Voice Transmission’ (傳音入密). In short, it’s also referred to as ‘Voice Transmission’.


 -Voice Transmission… Is this a technique that others cannot hear?


 -That’s right. It’s a technique truly suitable for having secret conversations, like between you and me. Isn’t it nice?


 -Yes, it is.


 It certainly seemed like a useful technique.


 Using very faint qi to create vibrations and transmit sound.


 He had no particular desire to learn it, but since she had taught him on her own accord, it would likely come in handy.


 As they were conversing, she transmitted a message to him.


 -I watched your duel, and it was truly magnificent.


 -Thank you.


 -Originally, the Valley Master had come to take a female disciple, but it was a duel that made me change my mind.


 At her words, Mok Gyeong-un chuckled inwardly.


 She was openly revealing her intentions.


 As expected, there was a purpose behind teaching him this technique.


 -Ah, hearing you say that, I’m at a loss for words.


 -Hehehe. Child, let me be direct. Become this Valley Master’s disciple. Such opportunities are rare.


 Hang Yeo-ryang, the Valley Master of the Summoning Sound Valley, blatantly proposed for him to become her disciple.


 In fact, her proposal was indeed a rare occurrence.


 The final gate hadn’t even ended yet, and the closing ceremony hadn’t taken place, so approaching a student and persuading them to become a disciple was something that wouldn’t happen unless they were exceptionally fond of them.


 However, the problem was that Mok Gyeong-un himself had no intention whatsoever of becoming the Valley Master of the Summoning Sound Valley’s disciple.


 Mok Gyeong-un transmitted a message with a regretful expression.


 -Oh my, what should I do? I am truly grateful for the Valley Master’s offer, but I need more time to consider it.


 He expressed it politely since she had taught him something.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) It was essentially no different from a refusal.


 At this, Hang Yeo-ryang let out a small snort.


 ‘Do you think you can escape from this Valley Master?’


 She had already made up her mind to accept Mok Gyeong-un as her disciple.


 Therefore, she was determined to make him beg her to accept him as a disciple, using whatever means necessary.


 -If you’re considering the two kings, I’d like to tell you that it’s a foolish choice.


 -A foolish choice?


 -Bright Blade King Son Yun already has four disciples and a designated successor. If you were to join them, do you think you’d be able to fully showcase your talent?


 -Ah… Is that so?


 -Hehehe. From the looks of it, you must have thought of choosing Thunderbolt Fist King in mind. But do you know this?


 -What are you referring to?


 -The Thunderbolt Fist King’s only disciple became crippled in his right arm while learning his secret techniques.


 ‘Hmm.’


 At her words, Mok Gyeong-un stroked his chin.


 In fact, he hadn’t chosen anyone yet.


 Originally, he had his sights set on Baek Sa-ha, the Poison Annihilation King, but since he didn’t attend as a spectator, his original plan had been disrupted.


 

 However, if what Hang Yeo-ryang said was true, becoming a disciple of the two kings might turn out to be quite troublesome.


 ‘Internal competition or the risk of martial arts?’


 Whichever it was, it became unpleasant to choose.


 However, this information was ultimately Hang Yeo-ryang’s attempt to exclude these two individuals.


 Therefore, Mok Gyeong-un considered it as information to be referenced, nothing more, nothing less.


 -Yes, I will keep the Valley Master’s advice in mind.


 -…


 At Mok Gyeong-un’s words, which seemed to draw a line, she tapped her fingers on the chair.


 This kid seemed to be more stubborn than he appeared.


 If it weren’t for the final gate or the closing ceremony, she would have wanted to forcibly take him away and reshape his mental state to her liking.


 However, the most troublesome person was right across the platform.


 Bright Blade King Son Yun.


 He was someone who interfered and obstructed her affairs at every turn.


 But now, that time was not far off.


 Once she reached the seventh stage, the pinnacle of the Sound Wave Transmission Technique (派攻音響功), no one would be able to stand against her, except for the two among the Five Kings who had attained the realm of Awakening.


 Even the Bright Blade King was no exception.


 Thus, she decided to change her approach and try to coax and persuade Mok Gyeong-un this time.


 -Do you know why this Valley Master only wanted to accept female disciples?


 -…


 -This Valley has always accepted mostly female disciples, except in truly special cases. And it’s not limited to disciples. The majority of those in my Valley are women.


 -…


 -If you become this Valley Master’s disciple, you’ll be able to enjoy the feeling of being the First Emperor of the Epang Palace[2]. Doesn’t it tempt you?


 -…I apologize.


 Mok Gyeong-un flatly refused her temptation.


 ‘Look at this brat.’


 He should be at an age where his blood was boiling, yet he even rejected such a proposal?


 At this sight, Hang Yeo-ryang’s annoyance started to rise, going beyond his stubbornness.


 Originally, she had a whimsical temperament and didn’t engage in persuading others or such acts.


 If she liked something, she would forcibly take it, that’s all.


 ‘If he keeps responding like this…’


 Her patience was reaching its limit, but she decided to endure it one last time.


 -From what I can see, you seem to be learning sword techniques. In that case, wouldn’t it be even better to become this Valley Master’s disciple?


 -…What do you mean by that?


 -The Bright Blade King and the Shadow Master are masters of blade techniques, and the Thunderbolt Fist King, as his title suggests, is a master of the Thunderstrike Fist. However, judging from the duel, it seems that what you primarily trained in is sword techniques.


 She considered Mok Gyeong-un’s sword techniques to be more refined than his fist techniques during the duel.


 In that regard, she deduced that Mok Gyeong-un had mainly practiced sword techniques.


 At that moment, Mok Gyeong-un spoke,


 -As far as I know, the Valley Master is primarily skilled in sound techniques.


 -Hehehe. While that is certainly true, the Valley Master is also a master of the sword, comparable to my own sound techniques. I can confidently say that if you learn the Striking Sword Technique[3], one of my Valley’s legacies, you will reach an even higher realm of swordsmanship.


 ‘Striking Sword Technique?’


 Did she also have proficiency in sword techniques?


 However, there was one fact that Hang Yeo-ryang was unaware of.


 Mok Gyeong-un smiled and said,


 -I am grateful for your words, but I don’t necessarily have to focus on sword techniques.


 Although she didn’t know, Mok Gyeong-un hadn’t devoted himself solely to the sword.


 He was prepared to learn whatever he deemed necessary.


 However, Mok Gyeong-un’s response ultimately angered Hang Yeo-ryang.


 -Tsk!


 ‘This Valley Master is offering such a proposal, yet he keeps arrogantly refusing.’


 If carrots didn’t work, then the answer was the whip.


 In fact, that was more convenient for her.


 -This Valley Master is holding you in such high regard and trying to accept you as a disciple, yet you are being utterly arrogant. Very well. In that case, I’ll have to accept that Mok Yu-cheon brat who is currently engaged in a duel as a subordinate of my Valley.


 ‘Mok Yu-cheon?’


 Mok Yu-cheon and the evil spirit possessing Yeom Ga from the Vermillion Slaughter Cave were in the midst of a fierce duel at the training ground in the center of the plaza.


 They were almost evenly matched.


 Most of the leaders were also watching their duel with interest.


 -I heard that the child is your younger brother, right?


 Before the duel, when Won Byeong-hak, the Thunderbolt Fist King, learned that the two shared the same surname, Mok, he had asked if they were siblings.


 In response, Lee Ji-yeom, the Corpse Blood Valley Master, deemed it acceptable to reveal that information and confirmed it.


 That was how she knew about it.


 -Yes, that’s correct.


 -I see. That child also seems quite useful. Don’t you think?


 -…


 -If he’s such a useful talent, I should accept him as a subordinate, play with him for a while, and then kill him when I lose interest.


 At her words, Mok Gyeong-un couldn’t help but chuckle.


 As he continued to express his refusal, she was now blatantly threatening him.


 Although she spoke indirectly, she was threatening to take his younger brother as a subordinate and kill him if Mok Gyeong-un didn’t become her disciple.


 ‘Try refusing again this time.’


 She twitched her lips and looked at Mok Gyeong-un with malicious eyes.


 Considering that both siblings had made it to this stage, they must have relied on each other while passing through the gates.


 In that case, their brotherly bond should be deep.


 ‘If you don’t want to let your younger brother die, obediently become the Valley Master’s disciple…’


 -Do as you please.


 ‘!?’


 Suddenly, upon hearing Mok Gyeong-un’s transmitted voice echoing in her ears, her expression, which had been twitching her lips venomously, stiffened.


 What did he mean by doing as she pleased?


 For a moment, she doubted her own ears.


 Hang Yeo-ryang spoke in a voice mixed with anger,


 -You must think that this Valley Master wouldn’t actually do it.


 She was someone who followed through on her words.


 How dare a mere student not listen to her words and respond in such a manner?


 Fine. Then she would truly show him.


 -It’s all your own doing. Let’s see if you can remain so composed after losing your younger brother.


 -Yes, yes. Do as you please.


 -Ha! You…


 -You can kill him, I don’t mind, and you can even dismember him and turn him into a cripple after playing with him. After all, that’s the Valley Master’s decision for the subordinate you’re taking in.


 

  -What?


 -If my younger brother can make the Valley Master happy even in such a way, that would be quite fortunate.


 -Tsk!


 He says that with a smile on his face.


 -…


 Suddenly, rather than her anger rising, she was left dumbfounded.


 What was wrong with that brat?


 Although there was a distance between them, as someone who had reached the Transcendent Realm, she could see Mok Gyeong-un’s face to a certain extent.


 How could he smile and say it was fine to kill his younger brother or turn him into a cripple?

 It wasn’t an expression of pretending to be composed while scheming something.


 His face truly seemed to convey that he didn’t mind.


 ‘…Is that kid really in his right mind?’
