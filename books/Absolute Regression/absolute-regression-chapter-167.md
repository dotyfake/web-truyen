# Absolute Regression Chapter 167 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Seo Dae-ryong kinh ngạc khi nghe Chung-ui nói về việc tạo ra một cơ thể "không thể đọc được hay nuốt chửng". Nếu cậu trở nên miễn nhiễm với độc, không loại độc nào trên thế giới có thể giết được cậu. Dae-ryong vô cùng ấn tượng với Geommu-geuk (Kiếm Vũ Cực).

Chung-ui hỏi Dae-ryong có ghen tị không, nhưng cậu đáp rằng không hề. Cậu biết rõ vị trí của mình và tin rằng mỗi người có một "bát chứa định mệnh" riêng. Bát của cậu đủ lớn để cậu dốc toàn lực vào giải đấu Tiểu Long (Little Dragon Tournament), và nó đã lớn hơn rất nhiều từ khi gặp Chung-ui. Chung-ui lo lắng về con đường mà định mệnh sẽ dẫn dắt cậu, nhưng cậu không thể trốn tránh nó.

Chung-ui tiếp tục thêm các nguyên liệu vào thùng thuốc, mùi càng lúc càng tệ. Đến nguyên liệu cuối cùng, mùi hôi thối biến thành một mùi hương kỳ lạ. Dae-ryong đặt tay lên thùng thuốc và cầu nguyện.

Ban đầu, Dae-ryong tưởng mình sắp chết vì mùi kinh khủng. Chung-ui đưa cho cậu một viên thuốc và nói đó là thuốc "giả chết" trong hai ngày. Sau khi uống thuốc, Dae-ryong tỉnh dậy trên giường, Seo Dae-ryong đang nhìn cậu với vẻ mặt nghiêm trọng. Anh ta nói rằng đã quyết định không trả lại 500,000 nyang. Chung-ui bước vào và muốn nhận cậu làm đệ tử. Dae-ryong từ chối, nói rằng mình đã có sư phụ đáng sợ nhất trên đời. Cậu cũng không muốn "cắt đi cánh tay phải" của mình, ám chỉ việc rời bỏ chủ nhân.

Chung-ui đuổi Seodaeryong ra ngoài và bảo Dae-ryong ngồi dậy. Cô nói cơ thể cậu có mùi thơm và sẽ giữ mùi hương này trong vài ngày. Cô thú nhận rằng mình đã rất mệt mỏi cả về thể chất lẫn tinh thần. Việc giúp đỡ những đứa trẻ mồ côi là một cách để tự bảo vệ mình. Cô cảm thấy có một "mối lương duyên" khi thấy Janelle và khi biết Dae-ryong đã làm chủ được Thiên Mạch Cường Hóa Thuật (Heavenly Vein Strengthening Technique). Cô hỏi Dae-ryong có biết thứ gì trong rượu cậu vừa uống không, và tiết lộ đó là Vô Hình Chi Độc (Muhyeongjidok) – một loại độc không màu, không mùi, không vị, được mệnh danh là vua của các loại độc. Cô chúc mừng cậu vì giờ đây không loại độc nào trên thế giới có thể giết được cậu.

Dae-ryong bày tỏ lòng biết ơn sâu sắc đến Chung-ui. Cô nói rằng đây là ước mơ cả đời của mình, và giờ cô sẽ không phải lang thang khắp thế giới để tìm kiếm côn trùng độc nữa. Dae-ryong xoa bóp vai cho cô. Cô cảm thấy thoải mái hơn so với lần đầu gặp mặt. Cậu hỏi về mục tiêu của cô từ giờ trở đi, và cô nói rằng chỉ muốn được thoải mái. Cậu nói rằng cô cần phải nghiên cứu và phát triển những điều mới cho giới võ lâm, và bắt mạch cho cô, nói rằng cô sẽ sống thoải mái trong 50 năm tới. Cậu hứa sẽ quay lại và chữa khỏi bệnh cho cô.

Trước khi rời đi, Chung-ui đưa cho Dae-ryong một con côn trùng độc và bảo cậu ăn thử, nhưng cậu từ chối.

Trên đường trở về, Seodaeryong lo lắng về việc liệu mình có thể thắng giải đấu Tiểu Long (Little Dragon Tournament) hay không. Khi họ trở lại, họ thấy một thông báo của Võ Lâm Minh (Murim Alliance) rằng Seo Dae-ryong đã vào chung kết vì đối thủ của cậu đã gây ra một tai nạn chết người trong trận đấu trước. Đối thủ của cậu trong trận chung kết là Jin Ha-ryeong, cháu gái của minh chủ Võ Lâm Minh. Dae-ryong lo lắng đến mức không thể rút kiếm ra được. Sau đó, nhân vật chính lấy ra một chiếc túi từ trong áo, đó là chiếc túi đựng các chiến lược mà Hyeolcheon Doma đã đưa cho Seo Daeryong.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-166/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-168/)Episode 167: You start growing old the moment you quit your job.




Seo Dae-ryong was shocked by the words, ‘the body that cannot be read or swallowed.’


If he becomes invulnerable to poison, no poison in the world will work on him. This means that no poison can kill him. In the world of martial arts, poison is the thing that must be avoided the most, so his greatest weakness will disappear.


“You can achieve that so easily?”


“Your master will easily achieve it. My life of doing that work has been long and arduous to get to this point.”


Seo Dae-ryong was once again impressed by Geommu-geuk. How could he explain the fate of being brought to him to be cured and become an invincible being?


“Aren’t you jealous?”


“Not at all.”


“Why? You have to look so greedy.”


“That greedy person is a greedy person who knows his place. I think that each person has a vessel that holds his or her given destiny. My destiny vessel is the size that I have to give my all to win the Little Dragon Tournament. It has also become enormously large since I met you. In the past, I was really just a soy sauce paper.”


When I think back to the time when I had a dark and gloomy personality, full of revenge against my senior Hwangcheon-gak and resentment toward the Cheonmasingyo, I think I held on to a large piece of soy sauce.




“I have seen many times how big the vessel of destiny is, my lord. I still see it now. Rather than feeling jealous, I am grateful. Because later on, I will have one more thing to tell my grandchildren when they sit on my lap.”


“But why do you look so anxious?”


“I wonder what kind of fate it is that will lead me to take this path. I am the right-hand man by choice, so I cannot avoid that fate.”


“If you feel like your bowl is about to break, just run away.”


“Even if everyone else runs away, I can’t. You carried me all the way here without stopping for a moment and showed me how to give me 500,000 nyang. Thanks to you, I’m completely ruined. If I can’t run away anyway, isn’t there another Dafa that can make him stronger? Make him stronger.”


“All the ingredients I’ve been saving up are going in there. Even if I wanted to do it for you, I can’t do it anymore.”


Chung-ui rubbed his shoulder as if the pain was creeping up on him again.


Seo Dae-ryong rubbed her shoulder.


“No. You make other people’s bodies immune to poison, but you can’t fix your own sore shoulder?”


Chung-ui answered with a bitter smile.




“Everyone lives like that. You, you think you’re different? Oh, sideways. A little more to the right. Yeah, over there. Oh, it’s refreshing.”


The sword dance was locked in the theater for two more days from that day.


Chung-ui continued to add various ingredients to the barrel, and the smell became increasingly worse.


And when I added the last ingredient, something amazing happened.


The barrel that had been filled with a terrible smell began to smell fragrant.


It was a total lie. It wasn’t like the ingredients I mixed at the end had a scent that could completely eliminate the stench.


It felt like the strong smells were combining and combining again, and when the last one combined, it changed into something completely different and new.


Seo Dae-ryong put his hand on the barrel and prayed earnestly in his heart.


‘My lord, come on!’


\* \* \*




At first, I really thought I was going to die.


I would rather fall into the smelliest and dirtiest place in the world than this one. Oh, I can’t. This is the smelliest place in the world.


“Take this medicine and go in.”


“What kind of medicine is it?”


“It’s a drug that will kill you for two days. If you’re scared, you can give up now.”


“Giving up is a welcome medicine. It’s a place you can never enter alive.”


I took the medicine that Chung-ui gave me without hesitation.


I swallowed the medicine, closed my eyes once, and when I opened them again, I was lying in bed.


Only then did I realize that two days had passed. I had no dreams, and I had no memories. It seemed as if I had really died and woke up for two days.


When I opened my eyes like that, this time Seo Dae-ryong was looking down at me. He looked at me quietly and then said with a serious expression.


“After much thought, I have decided not to pay back the five hundred thousand nyang.”


The only person who can make me laugh the moment I open my eyes is Seo Dae-ryong.


“I never lent you five hundred thousand nyang.”


At that moment, Chung-ui came into the room and said.


“Leave that mischievous, thoughtful guy here. I should take him as my disciple.”


Then Seo Dae-ryong stepped back in fright.


“I wish I could do that, but I have a big job coming up.”


“I’ll come back when I’m done with work. What do you think?”


“I’m sorry, but I already have a master. And he’s the scariest person in the world.”


“Aren’t you afraid of bugs?”




“Of course I’m scared of bugs too.”


I could feel the sincerity mixed in with the playfulness of loyalty.


Seo Dae-ryong winked at me. What are you doing? He asked me to stop him.


Of course I didn’t stop him.


“Isn’t it not a bad idea to try living a new life?”


“As soon as you opened your eyes, you tried to cut off your right arm. I can’t cut off that right arm. When you gave me five hundred thousand nyang, my arm turned into eternal steel.”


I smiled and said to Chung-ui.


“I will contact you when that eternal iron has rusted and become worn out and falls off.”


I thought that although Seo Dae-ryong would not be a good fit, if I could find someone else who suited him, I would definitely recommend him as a disciple of loyalty.


“You go out for a moment.”


“yes.”


Loyalty sent Seodaeryong out.


“You can get up now.”


I got up from bed. I felt light even though I had been unconscious for two days. This is truly the power of profound medicine.


“Your body smells good.”

“It’s going to keep flying for a few days.”


“I hope this scent lasts.”


“If you do that, you’ll never be able to infiltrate anywhere again in your life.”


“Wouldn’t it be nice to live a life without doing things like infiltration?”


“Well, if I become a Heavenly Horse, I could live that kind of life.”


Chung-ui brought the wine and poured it for me.


“Here, have a drink.”


I drank the drink she poured me. She didn’t drink herself, but only filled my glass. After drinking three glasses in a row, she stopped filling my glass. I drank the drink, but she revealed her true feelings.


“Actually, I was very tired. I was exhausted both physically and mentally. Maybe helping the orphans was a struggle to protect myself. It was like a support that kept me from collapsing from exhaustion and from going out of control.”


I understood what you said. I had had similar experiences. When I was a ronin, Seojin protected me, and when I was collecting Dafa materials, my desire for revenge played that role.


Words of loyalty continued.


“When I saw Janelle, I felt a sense of destiny. It was something I had never felt before. Ah, to be honest, it was when I found out that you had mastered the Heavenly Vein Strengthening Technique. The time has finally come. The indifferent heavens have finally given me a chance.”


He turned his head out the window and looked up at the sky. My gaze naturally followed her outside.


“That damn sky, at least as far as my research is concerned, was a damn sky.”


Her gaze turned to me again.


“Do you know what was in the drink you just drank?”


“I didn’t feel anything.”


“It contained an invisible poison.”


I was surprised.


Muhyeongjidok is a colorless, odorless, and tasteless poison, and its power is so strong that it is called the king of poisons. It is the best poison in the world of poisons and the best in the world of poisons. Naturally, it is difficult to manufacture and even more difficult to detoxify.




“I am fine.”


“Congratulations. Now no poison in the world can kill you.”


Her words meant that the test was a success, and that I had become a mandok-invincible being.


“Intangible poison? Aren’t you making the confirmation too strong?”


“This way, I don’t have to double check.”


After creating the Mandok Bulsimjiche with her own hands and conducting the final test with the Intangible Poison, it was the culmination of her dreams in life.


I am now with a craftsman who is fulfilling her lifelong dream. I felt all the emotions she felt: joy, relief, bittersweetness, regret. Maybe this is the emotion I will feel when I kill the fire weapon.


I bowed deeply to her.


“thank you.”


“I’m grateful, too. This has been a lifelong dream of mine. Now I won’t have to wander the world looking for poisonous insects any longer.”


The reason her body was so sick was because she got it while trying to find poison.


I went up to her and rubbed her shoulders.


“Oh my, it feels refreshing.”


“Come to think of it, I’ve never even massaged Dad’s shoulders.”


“What an unfilial son.”


“You may not know this, but I’m the kind of person who would risk my life just to rub your shoulder.”


He laughed as if he found loyalty amusing.


As I was rubbing her shoulders from behind, I felt that she was more relaxed than when we first met. It felt like she had just reached her final climax and was starting to come down.


“What are your goals from now on?”


“What’s your goal? Just be comfortable.”




“It’s not possible.”


“no?”


The moment someone who has been passionately devoted to something stops working, that’s when they start to age terribly. They start to get sicker.


“You need to research and develop new things for the martial arts world. So please give it to me again.”


“The real greedy one is here.”


I, who was massaging her shoulder, stepped forward and grabbed Chung-ui’s wrist. As I held her wrist as if I was taking her pulse, she stared at me.


I pretended to take her pulse and then said to her.


“You will live comfortably for the next fifty years. Just work!”


She also had an expression on her face that said she understood and knew why I was saying this.


“Hey, you. You want me to live fifty more years while saying it hurts? Don’t say bad things.”


“I will come back to you and make sure you get better.”


“Thank you, even if it’s just empty words.”


“Thank you is something I will have to say to you for the rest of my life. Thanks to you, I will live my life without worrying about addiction.”


“It was a task that could have either succeeded or failed. But you bravely risked your life. Consider this a reward for your courage.”


“I will repay this favor for a long time. If you ever need my help, please send a message to the West Lake Guest House in the Central Plains and I will definitely come and see you.”


“Okay.”


I went out with her.


Seo Dae-ryong greeted us with a happy face.


“My congratulations to you both.”


So when we were about to leave after saying our goodbyes, Chung-ui held out a poisonous insect.




“Try one of these and go! It’s delicious.”


“I’m sorry, but I hate bugs too.”


I ran first, and Seo Dae-ryong ran after me.


Chung-ui, who was watching the backs of the two people walking away, looked up at the sky.


“I have fulfilled my duty as a member of the National Assembly.”


She looked up at the sky for a moment, then habitually rubbed his shoulder and went inside.


“Oh my, it’s my arm.”


\* \* \*


I carried Seodaeryong on my back and ran at full speed.


Seo Dae-ryong felt less tired than before. This was because he had already experienced it once and his internal energy had increased.


He was carried and had all kinds of worries.


“Can I win? Who will I face? Will I be eliminated because I arrived late? Or will I die in the battle of the four rivers like in my dream?”


“Stop worrying about useless things!”


“It’s my own trick. I keep imagining the worst-case scenario, which makes me lose my motivation, and then I try not to let it happen in reality.”


“Was it effective?”


“I don’t know. The worst hasn’t happened yet.”


“That’s why you’re saying worrying is useless!”


When we barely made it back in time, an unexpected situation awaited us.


“uh?”


Seodaeryong looked at the Murim Alliance poster with a surprised expression. It was a poster conveying news related to the current Little Dragon War.




“I made it to the finals?”


An accident occurred at the next Jo Pal-gang Bimu after Seo Dae-ryong.


In that match, an accident occurred where one side suffered a fatal injury, and the opponent’s intention was revealed. As a result, the opponent that Seo Dae-ryong was supposed to face in Sa Gang was eliminated, and he automatically advanced to the finals.


“Didn’t I say that dreams are the opposite? That all worries are useless?”


At my words, Seo Dae-ryong still couldn’t take his eyes off the official document posted on the wall.


“I… …Can I go to the finals like this?”


“I didn’t cheat or use foul play. What’s there that I can’t do? It’s been said since ancient times that even those with talent or hard work can’t beat those with luck.”


“I wasn’t this lucky.”


“As you live, your luck changes.”


Seo Dae-ryong looked back at me. His emotions were in his eyes. That luck, it’s all thanks to you, sir.


“When I decided to participate in the Little Dragon Tournament, I really wanted to win and help the Lord. Now, there’s only one more step left.”


“That last one is the problem.”


An opponent who was not supposed to be lucky has advanced to the finals. Without allowing any surprises, Jin Ha-ryeong, the granddaughter of the Murim Alliance leader, has advanced to the finals.


So, this final became a showdown between Seo Dae-ryong, the embodiment of surprises, and Jin Ha-ryeong, the perennial championship candidate.


“What should I do? I’m so nervous I don’t think I can pull out the sword.”


“Even if you can’t pull out the sword, you can still read, right?”


“Huh? What are you talking about?”


I took out a pouch from my bosom. It was the pouch of strategies that Hyeolcheon Doma had given to Seo Daeryong.


“It means it’s finally time to write this.”
