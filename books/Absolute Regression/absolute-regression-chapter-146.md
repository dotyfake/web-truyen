## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Trong chương này, Diệp Trần (nhân vật chính) cùng Tà Thương Ma (evil Soma) tiếp tục đối mặt với nguy hiểm. Diệp Trần ghi tên mình bên cạnh tên Tà Thương Ma trên danh sách sinh tử của Diêm Vương (King of Hell), thể hiện quyết tâm cùng sống chết.

Một trong Tam Huyết Quân (Bloodthirsty Three Armies) tức giận vì sự thất bại của Thiên Đường Yêu Cơ (Paradise Fairy), người có vẻ là "chị dâu" của hắn. Diệp Trần lợi dụng sự tức giận này để kích động Tam Huyết Quân, đồng thời tiết lộ việc cả hai đã giết Bách Manh Kì (Baek Mang-gi), kiếm hoàng, khiến mọi người kinh ngạc và hoang mang.

Diệp Trần quyết định giao đấu với Huyết Lang Đồ (Hyulrangdo) và ra lệnh cho hắn phải dốc toàn lực. Trong trận chiến, Diệp Trần đã hấp thụ nội công của Thiên Đường Yêu Cơ ngược lại, tạo lợi thế lớn. Cậu liên tục tấn công, khiến Huyết Lang Đồ từ tự tin chuyển sang nôn nóng, và cuối cùng bẻ gãy cổ tay hắn. Diệp Trần kết liễu Huyết Lang Đồ, khiến hắn chết trong sự hối hận vì đã cả đời ép người khác giao chiến.

Sau khi Huyết Lang Đồ chết, Diệp Trần hỏi Diêm Vương có ghi tên Huyết Lang Đồ không. Diêm Vương bị Tam Huyết Quân ngăn lại, và Diệp Trần giao chiến với chúng. Tam Huyết Quân phối hợp rất ăn ý, gây khó khăn cho Diệp Trần. Tuy nhiên, Diệp Trần sử dụng không gian hệ để tách một người ra và nhanh chóng giết chết hắn. Sau đó, cậu tiếp tục sử dụng không gian hệ để kết liễu hai người còn lại, khiến cả ba chết một cách vô nghĩa.

Trong khi đó, Tà Thương Ma giao chiến với Diêm Vương và giết chết hắn. Sau trận chiến, Tà Thương Ma hỏi Diệp Trần có bị thương không. Cả hai rời khỏi khách điếm, và gặp một người đàn ông đeo mặt nạ trắng. Người này có khí thế mạnh mẽ như Bách Manh Kì. Tà Thương Ma nhận ra đây là Sư Bá (Sa-Baek) Lương Triều Khí (Liang Cheo-gi), anh rể của sư phụ hắn và là kẻ đứng sau mọi chuyện. Lương Triều Khí ra lệnh cho Tà Thương Ma cởi mặt nạ.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-145/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-147/)146th No matter how urgent it is, it’s like that.




The King of Hell opened the list of living beings.


Then I took out a small container of blood, dabbed it with a brush, and wrote my name next to that of the evil Soma.


The gaze of the King of Hell, who had previously looked like a half-crazy man, changed. It seemed as if he had returned to normal, or as if he were looking downright crazy.


“Our names are written side by side, so we will die together even if we die.”


The evil Soma laughed at my words.


The first of the three blood soldiers who were examining the corpse of the Paradise Princess in our spare time suddenly shouted.


“You little punks! Don’t laugh!”


He stood up from his seat and glared at me coldly.


“Yohui has never failed in her seduction technique before. So what happened?”


“It seems that my older sister saw that my younger brother’s internal energy was lacking and wanted to help him.”




“Cut that nonsense out!”


He was genuinely angry. And I could sense that. That anger was deeply personal. It seems that the second or third of the Bloodthirsty Three Armies should have called the Paradise Yohee “sister-in-law.”


The first one said while looking at the evil Soma.


“You knew that guy wouldn’t suffer.”


Of course, the evil Soma believed me.


The evil Soma looked at me. Our eyes met in the air and exchanged messages.


– Now confess with your own mouth. That I killed the demon lord.


-No, I have never done that.


-You will hear it someday.


The eyes of the evil soma in the mask’s eye sockets were smiling. The eldest of the Blood Three Army showed his anger at the sight of us leisurely looking at each other and smiling.




“Yes, smile. Even as you go to hell, smile as you go.”


I said to the first of the three blood soldiers.


“He told you this and drove you into a corner? That Soma-nim and I killed the Emperor Baek Mang-gi.”


“what?”


First, not only the first, but also the other villains there were shocked. They knew that even if they joined forces, there was no guarantee that they would be able to kill the Sword Emperor Baek Mang-gi. Furthermore, now that even the Paradise Fairy was dead.


“He probably didn’t believe you could kill us. He just used you to injure us or drain our energy.”


The others looked at each other. This time I didn’t give them a chance to come up with a plan.


I told Hyulrangdo.


“Blood wolf, it’s a matter of life and death.”


He returned the same words he had said to the evil Soma earlier.




“You said you’ve been searching for a strong person your whole life? Well, here comes the person you’ve been looking for.”


He pulled out the black magic sword and spoke to the evil Soma.


“Anyone who interferes with this mission will be killed.”


Originally, this was a match that should have been given to the evil Soma. However, this was a situation where no variables could be allowed. We had to deal with them without getting hurt as much as possible and get out of here. The real enemy was waiting for us outside.


The evil Soma also guessed my intentions and meekly gave this match to me.


“I will do that.”


Excluding Hyulrangdo, there were still four left, but the evil Soma answered confidently.


Rather, the person who was most flustered in this situation was Hyulrangdo. He must have felt fearful inside because he had seen me absorb the inner energy of the Paradise Princess in reverse. The momentum was in my favor. I pushed him even harder.


“If you had truly set out to find a strong person, would you still be alive? If you really had such intentions, why didn’t you go to the leader of the martial arts world? Why didn’t you come to find our father?”


“… … .”


“You don’t want to fight me, do you? But you’ve spent your whole life forcing fights on people who don’t want to fight. Now, you should experience the same thing.”


The moment he finished speaking, I ran towards Hyulrangdo.


Hyulrangdo pulled out the straight sword.


Although he was behind in momentum at the start of the fight, Hyulrangdo was not a man with a fake reputation. His magic was fast, accurate, and powerful.


The sword flew in with the force of breaking my sword.


When the sword and the sword clashed, there was no sound of a clang, but a loud thunderous boom. The sword and the sword were filled with internal energy, and a battle of inner strength ensued. The shame of being hit hard was carried into his sword.


Knock, knock, and knock again.


He pushed like crazy. If it had been another unmanned man, his sword would have already broken or his wrist would have been broken.


But I blocked it, and blocked it, and blocked it again.


I saw his expression change from moment to moment as the swords clashed against each other. The composure he had when he first attacked, when he thought he had gained momentum, gradually turned into impatience. Perhaps his wrist was starting to hurt.




Now, slowly, the positions are beginning to change.


I was the one who was knocking. The black magic sword began to strike down his sword. It was not a flashy herbivore fight, but a fight of internal strength that he had intended to push him into.


The sword was swung so quickly that I couldn’t dodge or use any other techniques.


Boom! Boom! Boom! Boom!


As the heavy impact continued, a miserable scream was mixed in with the impact.


“Kwaaaaak!”


His wrist was broken during the fight.


But my sword did not stop.


His sword broke as he was unable to infuse his strength into the next move, and his body was cut lengthwise vertically in the next move.


“Isn’t this the life you wanted? To die fighting someone stronger than you.”


But I saw the resentment and regret in his eyes at the last moment. Yes, it is easy to say, but it is not easy to truly live that kind of life.


Hyulrangdo fell forward, blood gushing out in a straight line from his crown to his navel. He spent his entire life forcing others to win, and eventually died, having his old ways returned to him.


The King of Hell and the Three Blood Lords watched this scene silently. It was partly because of the evil Soma, but also because they could not find an opportunity to intervene in this vicious power struggle.


They probably didn’t know that Hyulrangdo would lose to me. The internal energy battle that was forced through brute force was Hyulrangdo’s specialty.


I spoke to the King of Hell again.

“Did you write it down? The name of Hyulrangdo too?”


Even though Hyulrangdo died right before his eyes, he wasn’t scared at all.


“I couldn’t write your name because there wasn’t enough space.”


When he came out to me, the eldest of the Bloodthirsty Three Army stopped him.


“You lunatic. Your opponent is over there.”


The first of the three bloodthirsty soldiers is trying to kill me and take revenge on the Paradise Fairy.


I walked towards them with my blood-dripping sword down. Then, naturally, the evil Soma faced the Yama God Army.


“Did you write down your name in advance?”


In response to the evil Soma’s question, the King of Hell shouted in a thunderous voice.


“I am a messenger sent by the King of Hell. The King of Hell is looking for you!”


Phew! Kwaang!


The King of Hell clashed with the evil Soma’s Demonic Lightning Strike.


In the aftermath, a strong wind blew towards us and the fight between me and the Bloodthirsty Three Army began.


Three people rushed toward me at the same time.


The first one was aimed at my black face, the second was aimed at my chest, and the third was aimed at my legs.


Chaeng! Chaeng! Chaeng!


I almost instantly parried the sword that was flying at me. I was fast. No, I had to be fast. Their attacks were at a speed that if you weren’t fast, you would definitely get stabbed somewhere.


The direction of the stabs kept changing. This time, the first one was aimed at the chest, the second at the stomach, and the third at the face. The next time, it was different again.


It seemed that the order of attack had already been determined through dozens or hundreds of practices and experiences. This passing technique was a perfect combination of attacks that studied the opponent’s psychology well. It was truly a merciless attack that would have stabbed me several times if it weren’t for me.


Champ champ champ champ!




He kept getting pushed back and fended off their attacks.


Then, taking advantage of the opportunity, he attacked.


When the Black Sword stabbed the first one, the second one defended together, and the third one stabbed me.


They fought together their whole lives, so they fought as if they had three bodies but one heart. It was a fight against a monster with three heads and six arms. It was a much more difficult opponent than the Blood Wolf that they had fought before. I was sure. Of the four villains that had come today, these were the most difficult to deal with.


Four swords crossed up and down, intertwining. A fierce battle of offense and defense continued without allowing even a single mistake.


I had no intention of prolonging this fight, so I thought of a method I had never used before.


The moment they were pushing me.


Sssssut.


The second child looked around in surprise. Suddenly, the first and third children disappeared, and I was left standing alone in the field.


I used space-time teleportation to take only my second child to a new space.


To the remaining first and third eyes, it would have seemed as if our new form had disappeared in an instant.


The second one shouted at me.


“Is this illusion? How cowardly!”


“Well, isn’t one-on-one cowardly by your standards?”


They rushed at him. Even the three of them couldn’t kill me, so he couldn’t fight me alone.


Outside, the first and third children were looking around in surprise.


If the other person had disappeared alone, it would have been fine, but the second one disappeared as well.


At that moment, the second child’s corpse suddenly appeared as if it had fallen. At that moment, the third child was shocked by the second child’s corpse suddenly appearing before his eyes.


Phew! Phew!


The black magic sword that had emerged from between the corpse’s armpits stabbed the third’s heart. Given their skill level, it was a death that seemed too meaningless, but the opponent was me, who had applied the art of time-space teleportation to real combat.




The third one also collapsed without even being able to scream.


I thought the first one would lose his mind and run like a madman.


But what he chose was to escape. He tried to break through the wall of one of the guest rooms and escape, but a flash of lightning blocked his path.


He turned around in surprise and ran away. He threw the corpse of the Paradise Fairy on the floor at me. He was trying to kill me to get revenge on her.


“No matter how urgent it is, this isn’t it?”


“Shut up, you little shit!”


He thought the fight was already over, so he went crazy trying to survive. He screamed and swung his sword like a madman. But it was a futile struggle.


Before even five moves had passed.


Phew!


The black magic sword stabbed his heart, and even faster, it cut his wrist.


Bam.


In his fallen hand he held a pouch. It was a pouch of poison that he was going to spray at me. He had intended to spray poison at me and kill me the moment I was stabbed by the sword.


I knew from the beginning that they were such vicious people. But I just thought that their end was too late. They committed all sorts of evil deeds throughout their lives, and now they are dying at such a late age. If I hadn’t regressed, I wouldn’t have died here.


Isn’t this so unfair? That’s why everyone laments that even heaven is indifferent.


When my fight was over, the fight of the evil Soma was also over.


King Yeomra was already dead, face down in his own register, his forehead pierced by a bloody wound. The blood that flowed out soaked his register of deaths.


“You’ve been pretending to be the messenger of the King of Hell all your life, but the King of Hell himself would say that to you. Who are you? When did I send you?”


At my words, the evil Soma laughed and asked.


“Are you hurt anywhere?”


“It’s okay. How about you, Soma?”




“I’m okay too.”


Even though it seemed like we won easily, in reality, they were formidable opponents who would not have been at all strange if any of us had died.


But we coped well and got through this crisis safely this time too. We’ve been going through life-or-death crises together like this, unintentionally.


“Your skills have improved again since I last saw you. Just how strong do you plan to become?”


“I intend to see it through to the end.”


“You are at this level now, but if you learn the Nine-Handed Magic Technique, you will have no rivals in the world.”


I really hope so. I really, really hope no one becomes my opponent.


Before I left, I put money on the cash register at the entrance to the guest house. It was enough to repair the broken guest house and buy new furniture. It was money for the inn owner who had probably run away somewhere. Today’s incident must have been forced upon him.


“Now this doesn’t seem so strange.”


“As you know, the magic I pursue is one that doesn’t break tables.”


“Do you believe that we can become good people?”


“I don’t want us to be good people.”


“sure?”


“At the very least, I want to protect what needs to be protected. At the very least, after becoming a human, there should be a magic, a degree, and an apostle, right? That’s all I want.”


The evil soma stared at me silently for a moment. I couldn’t tell what he was thinking as he looked at me, but at least it was certain that he was gradually getting used to me.


“Let’s go out.”


“Yes, that’s right.”


We walked out of the guest house together.


There were no pedestrians outside. It was a truly empty street.


A man wearing a white mask stood in front of him.




Even though he was just standing there, I felt an enormous presence. It was a presence no less than that of the Sword Emperor Baek Mang-gi.


I could tell. The interest was a fake who had been pretending to be the evil soma, and he was also the mastermind behind this trap.


“You’ve been hanging out with demons, so now you’ve forgotten your manners?”


The evil Soma stared at him with complicated eyes for a moment before speaking in a calm tone.


“I am meeting with Master Sa-Baek.”


He was someone I knew. He was none other than the brother-in-law of the evil soma master, Liang Cheo-gi. When I had a relationship with the evil soma before returning, he had told me about this Sa-baek.


The shepherd spoke to the evil soma in a commanding tone.


“Take off your mask.”
