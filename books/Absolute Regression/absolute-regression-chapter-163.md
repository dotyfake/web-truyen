# Absolute Regression Chapter 163 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Geommugeuk xuất hiện tại buổi tiệc với diện mạo hoàn toàn mới: y phục lộng lẫy, râu cạo nhẵn, tóc chải chuốt. Sự thay đổi này khiến mọi người, đặc biệt là Jin Ha-ryeong, phải ngước nhìn. Cô thậm chí còn thầm nghĩ rằng Geommugeuk chính là mẫu người lý tưởng của mình.

Geommugeuk tiến đến chỗ Jin Ha-ryeong và Jo Shin, khiến cô ngạc nhiên khi anh nhận ra mình. Cô không thể tin được người trước mặt lại chính là Geommugeuk mà cô từng biết. Anh nhắc lại lời cô từng nói: "Nếu có ai bắt nạt cậu, cứ nói với tôi."

Jo Shin cũng sốc không kém. Hắn ta cảm thấy bị đe dọa bởi vẻ ngoài nổi bật của Geommugeuk, đặc biệt khi anh ta tiếp cận Jin Ha-ryeong. Jo Shin thầm nguyền rủa vì kế hoạch hạ thấp Geommugeuk của mình đã phản tác dụng, khi mà giờ đây anh ta còn thu hút hơn.

Geommugeuk còn khiến Jo Shin bẽ mặt khi tiết lộ việc Jo Shin đã đưa tiền cho anh mua quần áo mới. Jin Ha-ryeong hiểu lầm rằng Jo Shin đang muốn chuộc lỗi. Jo Shin tức giận nhắn tin cho Geommugeuk, bảo anh ta biến khỏi buổi tiệc.

Tuy nhiên, Geommugeuk phớt lờ và bắt đầu thưởng thức đồ ăn thức uống một cách tự nhiên, thu hút mọi ánh nhìn. Jin Ha-ryeong và Jo Shin bám theo anh. Khi Jin Ha-ryeong hỏi vì sao trước đây anh không ăn mặc như vậy, Geommugeuk đáp: "Sao một người hầu lại phải ăn mặc đẹp chứ?"

Jo Shin tiếp tục nhắn tin cho Geommugeuk, chất vấn việc anh ta ăn mặc bảnh bao. Geommugeuk đáp trả bằng ánh mắt "Chính ngươi bảo ta làm vậy mà." Jo Shin quyết tâm phải hạ bệ Geommugeuk bằng mọi giá. Hắn ta kéo Geommugeuk ra một góc và ra điều kiện: hoặc là Geommugeuk phải làm những việc khiến phụ nữ mất thiện cảm, hoặc là hắn sẽ giết anh. Geommugeuk ra giá 50.000 *nyang* trước và 50.000 *nyang* sau khi hoàn thành "công việc".

Khi Jin Ha-ryeong đến gần, Jo Shin vội vàng đổi giọng, khen ngợi Geommugeuk. Geommugeuk cũng không ngần ngại đáp lễ, khiến Jo Shin cảm thấy bất an. Sau đó, Jo Shin cố tình đề cập đến việc đầu tư lớn vào Liên minh Murim (Murim Alliance). Trong lúc Jo Shin khoe khoang, Jin Ha-ryeong không rời mắt khỏi Geommugeuk, đặc biệt khi thấy anh nói chuyện vui vẻ với người khác.

Jo Shin sai người tìm cớ gây sự với Geommugeuk. Ho Young, một kẻ muốn lấy lòng Jo Shin, đã đứng ra thách đấu. Geommugeuk đồng ý giao đấu bằng võ thuật thay vì kiếm.

Trong trận đấu, Geommugeuk giả vờ né tránh vụng về, khiến mọi người cười ồ. Tuy nhiên, khi Ho Young mất cảnh giác, Geommugeuk đã tung một cú đấm hạ gục hắn. Ho Young ngã xuống, kéo theo cả bàn ăn và hất thức ăn lên người Jo Shin.

Geommugeuk vội vàng kiểm tra vết thương cho Ho Young, hành động này càng khiến Jo Shin xấu hổ. Jin Ha-ryeong bênh vực Geommugeuk, cho rằng Ho Young tự gây ra chuyện vì mất tập trung. Cô tạm biệt Jo Shin và rời khỏi buổi tiệc cùng Geommugeuk.

Trên đường về, Jin Ha-ryeong lo lắng cho sự an toàn của Geommugeuk. Anh bất ngờ gọi cô là "bạn", nhắc nhở cô hãy giữ vẻ ngoài kiêu hãnh và đừng lo lắng cho anh. Jin Ha-ryeong hỏi liệu cô có thể tin anh không, Geommugeuk khẳng định rằng họ là bạn. Anh cũng yêu cầu cô hứa rằng nếu có bất kỳ điều gì kỳ lạ xảy ra, cô sẽ tìm đến anh. Jin Ha-ryeong đồng ý. Geommugeuk nói thêm, "Ngay cả khoảnh khắc kỳ lạ và khó hiểu như bây giờ?" Jin Ha-ryeong tin vào lời nói của Geommugeuk, quyết định sẽ thể hiện vẻ ngoài mạnh mẽ và thanh lịch thay vì lo lắng vô ích.

**NOTICE: Many of the novels have been removed because they might cause violations, which we were not aware of earlier.**




[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-162/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-164/)The 163rd bean pod has one more layer.




The sword dance entered the main hall.


He was wearing a splendid new uniform and long robe, with his beard clean-shaven and his hair neatly combed. He caught everyone’s attention with every step he took.


It wasn’t just because he was handsome. He had a strange aura that drew people to him. He exuded a sense of ease that only those who were close to the pinnacle of nothingness could feel, and a mysterious and noble aura that no one could imitate.


Jin Ha-ryeong didn’t recognize Geommu-geuk. The moment he saw him, pure admiration came to mind.


‘stylish!’


It was really cool. If someone asked her what kind of person she liked, she could say this. That guy.


She wasn’t the only one who had such thoughts. Women were watching the sword dance with rapt attention. Men were equally captivated by their gazes.


“who is this?”


“I don’t know either. Who is it?”


“I’ve never seen a small business like this before.”




“handsome!”


Words like this were leaked out openly here and there.


Catching everyone’s attention, Geommugeuk walked towards where Jin Ha-ryeong and Jo Shin were standing.


‘Why are you coming to us? Oh, is this someone Jo-shin knows?’


While she was thinking that, Geommugeuk greeted her first.


“So-Jeong Jin is here too.”


Jin Ha-ryeong was startled.


‘Do you know me? Who are you to pretend to know me?’


The voice sounded familiar. However, even after hearing the voice, she still didn’t recognize the person. The difference between the sword dance she had seen so far and the sword dance she saw now was too great.


“You don’t recognize me, do you?”




Even at this very moment, I honestly didn’t recognize him. If someone had a similar voice, they would be a person, but I never thought they were the same person.


“Who are you?”


“You told me to tell you if someone is bullying me? Do you think I’ll help you like this? You’ll bully me without even knowing it?”


At that moment, Jin Ha-ryeong opened his eyes wide. It was exactly what he had said. If anyone is bothering you, tell them, the granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world is your friend.


“No way? You!”


“That’s right. I’ll take it.”


Jin Ha-ryeong screamed without realizing it.


“I don’t know if this is something to scream about, but it’s true.”


Those clear and deep eyes that were not typical of a servant, when I looked at them again, they were indeed black smoke.


In an instant, a shiver ran through her body. Every hair on her body stood on end.




It’s nerve-wracking to be near such a handsome man, but this guy is the same swordsman who was your servant?


She asked in a trembling voice.


“What happened?”


“I shaved my beard and got my hair done. I even bought some new clothes.”


Jo Shin, who was standing next to him, was also flustered.


He was so shocked and embarrassed that he couldn’t react. He just blinked and stood there blankly.


At first, he didn’t recognize Geommu-geuk either. He was very proud of his appearance, so he felt a sense of rejection when he saw a man who was more handsome than him.


That’s why I was already in a bad mood when the sword dance drama appeared.


It was annoying that a guy more handsome than me was attending the banquet, but it was nerve-racking when he walked towards me with Jin Ha-ryeong. What the hell, you punk. Why are you coming this way?


‘But what? This guy is that guy? That dirty servant is that guy? No way? No way!’


Cho Shin almost screamed and swore.


‘That kid was this handsome?’


This completely ruined his plan. He had planned to erase the mystery and bring out the ordinary, but the real mystery came out. What made him even more angry was the fact that he had paid money to do it.


Geommugeuk greeted Josin, who was standing behind him.


“Your Majesty the King gave me money to buy clothes.”


Jin Ha-ryeong looked at Jo Shin with a surprised face.


“Really?”


“Oh, yes. That’s right.”


Jin Ha-ryeong misunderstood the situation.


“Oh, you really wanted to apologize. I honestly didn’t believe you. I’m sorry.”




“no.”


In truth, Jo Shin was in a state where he could neither laugh nor cry.


He sent a message straight to Geommugeuk.


-You little shit! Get out! Get out of here!


He was told to get out of the banquet hall, but Geommugeuk walked towards the later index members as if he had been told to leave the place.


“Oh! There are so many expensive and precious dishes. Can I eat as much as I want? Oh, there’s also alcohol here. It smells really good.”


Everyone was watching his every move. Geommu-geuk didn’t feel any pressure from the people’s gaze. He ate delicious food and drank alcohol. His actions were natural, as if he was the main character here.


Jin Ha-ryeong approached him as if possessed. Damn it, Jo-sin followed him.


“You really seem like a different person.”


“It’s because I usually go around in a very messy way.”


“Why didn’t you go like this?”


“Why would a servant have to dress up like that?”


When he saw Jin Ha-ryeong’s eyes sparkling towards Geommu-geuk, Jo Shin’s heart grew anxious.


‘This isn’t it. This isn’t it!’


I had to change this situation somehow. I was trying to remove the bean husk, but I ended up getting a stronger one.

Jo Shin sent a nervous message to Geommugeuk.


-You little punk! Why did you dress up so nicely?


Then Geommugeuk looked at him. Josin couldn’t refute the look in his eyes that said, “You’re the one who told me to dress up like this.”


Besides, he didn’t really do anything special. He just shaved his beard, fixed his hair, and bought new clothes. But even so, the sword dance performance was brilliant.


Cho Shin had to somehow bring down the sword dance.


“I dressed up to look good in front of our Lady Jin.”


“Yes, I tried to look cool.”


Jin Ha-ryeong’s cheeks turned slightly red, as if it sounded like she was trying to show off for herself.


The sight made Jo Shin feel sorry for him.


‘Damn it! This isn’t it either.’


It should be awkward, like it was forced on him. That guy always looked like he would suit such fancy clothes.


And yet, his actions were shameless and revealed, saying, “I made up my mind to come to that banquet.” This actually made him seem like a more confident person.


“It’s a coincidence that Lady Jin and I have the same color uniforms.”


“Yes.”


Jo Shin, who could no longer stand to see that sight, sent a message to one of his men to speak to Jin Ha Ryeong.


While Jin Ha-ryeong was receiving his greetings, Jo Shin took Geommu Geuk to a corner.


“You crazy bastard! Do you want to die?”


“Why are you doing that?”


“Do you want to take a hundred thousand nyang and show off your skills today? Or do you want to blow a hundred thousand nyang and die by my hand? It’s up to you.”


“So what should I do?”




“You have to do something that makes women lose their affection. Show off, pick fights with other people, and even get drunk! Got it?”


Jo-shin really didn’t know that such words would come out of his mouth. Has anyone ever tried to belittle someone so savagely? If he wanted to, he would have just killed them.


But now he was in a hurry. He had to embarrass himself somehow before the new bean pods got stuck in his eyes. He was really annoyed.


“Then give me the money first.”


“what?”


“I will do it if you give me 50,000 nyang. And when I am done, please give me another 50,000 nyang.”


“This kid! Do you want to die?”


Jo Shin raised his hand and tried to hit him, but Geommugeuk was not afraid.


“That’s just how business is. I need to eat to live.”


“This worn-out piece of trash!”


At that moment, Jin Ha-ryeong came walking towards us from over there. Jo Shin lowered the hand he had been holding and touched the tangles of Geommugeuk’s clothes.


“Our servant So-hyeop really looks like a different person.”


Then Geommugeuk said.


“As I said before, it’s all thanks to you, Confucius.”


“Honestly, it was money given for our Lady Jin.”


“You are truly generous and wonderful.”


Geommugeuk did not spare his praise for Josin.


Jo-shin felt uneasy, as if he had opened something that should not be opened.


But I couldn’t just back out like that.


Cho Shin changed the subject.




“This time, we plan to make a large investment in the Murim Alliance.”


When Jo Shin brought up the subject of work, Geommugeuk gave up his seat.


While Jo Shin was bragging about his family and money, Jin Ha Ryeong’s gaze kept on Geommu Geuk, who was talking to other post-graduates. In particular, when Yeo Hyup, who was listening to Geommu Geuk’s story, burst out laughing at what was so funny, Jin Ha Ryeong clenched his fist.


How could Jo-sin not know her heart?


Even though he had stopped talking, Jin Ha-ryeong continued to look towards Geommu-geuk.


Cho Shin’s expression hardened.


Jin Ha-ryeong suddenly felt a chill and turned her head. Jo Shin was silently staring at Geommu-geuk. The snake that had disappeared from her mind came back to her mind.


“It’s a shame to have someone like that as your servant. Don’t you think so?”


“What can I do with my innate destiny?”


There was a hint of regret in her answer. Chosin was really angry.


‘You damn bitch! Why are you ignoring me like this?’


A needless anger welled up in me.


He sent a message again to Ji-su Hu, who had previously told him to speak to Jin Ha-ryeong.


-Take advantage of the weapon and have a go at that kid. When you hit him, hit him without mercy.


The person who received the transmission was Hu Young.


Ho-young was a man who had the ambition to somehow look good to Jo-shin and raise his family. That was why he accepted the order without hesitation.


Hoyoung asked Geommugeuk.


“I see you’re carrying a sword. Have you learned martial arts?”


“That’s right.”


“How did your servant learn martial arts?”




“That’s because the owner is a great person.”


“Where can I learn a bit of the martial arts that that great man taught me?”


Everyone looked curious.


When Jin Ha-ryeong tried to stop her, Jo Shin said to her.


“Aren’t you curious, Lady Jin? How much and what kind of martial arts did that servant learn?”


Of course, I was curious about Jin Ha-ryeong, but I was more worried.


“But I don’t think it’s to the extent of competing with the later indexes.”


“Ho Mu-in is from a noble family, so he would not harm that servant.”


At that time, Geommugeuk said to Hoyoung.


“If you use a sword, you’ll get hurt, so let’s fight using martial arts.”


“great.”


Hoyoung was inwardly dumbfounded. He really didn’t know that he would fight so readily.


‘I’ll definitely break it somewhere.’


If you could pretend to break an arm or a leg and pretend it was a mistake, Jo-shin would be satisfied enough.


“Then please take it easy.”


“Okay. I’ve been a servant and a disciple for the rest of my life. It’s a really great day.”


Hoyoung let his guard down. It was embarrassing to show that he was nervous.


Geommu-geuk dodged Ho-young’s punch. He didn’t dodged it lightly, but dodged it while almost falling over. Laughter erupted here and there.


Hoyoung’s fist flew again, and this time Geommugeuk dodged it by rolling on the ground. Hoyoung, who had been chasing Geommugeuk like he was hunting, looked around and laughed.


“This is so refreshing… … .”




“be careful!”


The moment you turn your head at someone’s shout.


puck!


Hoyoung was knocked out by Geommu-geuk’s fist. He let his guard down and allowed a proper hit. In addition, he fell while breaking the table, and the food that was there splattered and stained Jo-shin’s clothes.


Jo Shin, who was already very angry, couldn’t hold it in any longer and exploded.


“What the heck!”


On the other hand, Geommugeuk ran and examined Hoyoung who had fallen.


“Fortunately, there were no serious injuries.”


Jo-shin felt embarrassed as he contrasted his actions of checking the opponent’s wounds with his own, swearing at him for getting food on his clothes. No one said anything, but there was contempt in the way they looked at him.


But what made him even more angry was that Jin Ha-ryeong didn’t even care about him and was only looking at Geommu-geuk.


“Sorry, I got excited and stopped.”


The sword dance drama apologized to the later indexes who were watching.


Jin Ha-ryeong spoke on their behalf.


“It’s not something to apologize for. It’s the fault of the person who wasn’t focused on the task.”


Everyone nodded to Jin Ha-ryeong’s words. At least in this fight, Ho-young let his guard down and got caught, so he couldn’t blame Geommu-geuk for his surprise attack.


Jin Ha-ryeong said goodbye to Jo Shin.


“Okay, I’ll leave now for today. Okay, you go too.”


Jin Ha-ryeong left the banquet hall with Geommu-geuk. Behind him, a loud crashing sound was heard. Although he didn’t know what was broken, he knew who had done it.


Geommugeuk returned walking along the moonlit path with Jin Ha-ryeong.


She was worried about the sword dance again.


“This incident puts you in more danger.”


Then Geommugeuk suddenly said.


“friend.”


For a moment, Jin Ha-ryeong was startled.


“Why are you so surprised? Didn’t we decide to be friends?”


“No, that’s right.”


“Friend. You are the granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world, the first beauty of Hubei, and the favorite to win the Little Dragon Championship. You are the most yourself and cool when you are proud and elegant. It doesn’t suit you to always worry about someone like this.”


After a moment, Jin Ha-ryeong said.


“Then can I trust you? Are you sure you’ll let me die a miserable death at the hands of that guy and not feel guilty for the rest of my life?”


“there is.”


“Really? How can you believe that?”


“Because we’re friends. Trust what your friend says.”


“You said I look cool and elegant, but I’m not that kind of woman. I’m a timid person who thinks a lot, worries a lot, and has a lot of regrets. I don’t like meeting people, and I don’t know how to get over my hurt. So you shouldn’t surprise me later.”


“Okay, I won’t do that.”


It was absurd, but she believed the words of the sword dance. She believed them even though there was no basis for her belief.


This time, Geommugeuk spoke.


“But please make me one promise.”


“What promise?”


“If anything strange or incomprehensible happens in the future, you will definitely come to me and tell me.”


It wasn’t just what I said about the recent Cheonmyeonghoe. It was also what I said when I felt signs of something that would happen to the Murim Alliance someday.


“A moment like that in my life… … .”


No matter how much she thinks about it.


“Right now?”


Then Geommugeuk said with a faint smile.


“Yeah, if something strange and incomprehensible like this happens, definitely. Okay, let’s go back now.”


Jin Ha-ryeong silently watched the back of Geommu-geuk, who was walking ahead. Suddenly, this thought occurred to him. As he said, it would be better to show the dignified and elegant appearance of Hobuk Il-mi instead of worrying about useless things.


She started walking towards the sword dance that was waiting in front of her, asking if she was coming.
