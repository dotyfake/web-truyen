# Absolute Regression Chapter 135 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Trong chương 135, nhân vật chính gặp lại cha mình tại quán rượu Amazon Net sau buổi gặp gỡ với Tứ đại Ma đầu. Cậu hỏi cha mình đến đây bằng cách nào, và nhận được câu trả lời quen thuộc: "Ta chỉ ghé qua thôi."

Cậu than thở rằng nếu không có cha đến, cậu đã tìm đến ông để xin lời khuyên về cách đối phó với đám ma đầu. Cha cậu bảo cậu đừng lo lắng về điều đó trong mười năm tới, ngụ ý rằng ông sẽ luôn ở bên cạnh giúp đỡ cậu.

Hai cha con cùng nhau uống rượu và ăn món rau xào đơn giản do Cho Chun-bae làm. Cậu hỏi cha về Chwima (Bloodthirsty Horse), và cha cậu bảo rằng đó là một người thích trêu chọc người khác, khuyên cậu nên cẩn thận. Ông cũng nhắc nhở cậu đừng cố gắng đoán ý người khác mà hãy đánh giá họ qua những gì mình thấy.

Cậu tò mò hỏi cha về những cuộc trò chuyện của ông với huynh đệ. Cha cậu nói điểm yếu của cậu là "tình cảm rẻ tiền," nhưng cậu lại xem đó là sức mạnh. Cậu muốn sống vui vẻ và không muốn đe dọa hay giết chóc. Cha cậu lo lắng rằng cậu sẽ chết nếu cứ tìm kiếm niềm vui trong công việc của họ. Cậu hứa sẽ trở nên mạnh mẽ hơn.

Sau đó, cậu xin cha chỉ dẫn để mạnh hơn. Cha cậu bảo cậu đánh nhau với ông trong quán rượu mà không được làm vỡ bất cứ thứ gì. Đây là một thử thách khó khăn vì không gian hẹp và có nhiều đồ đạc. Cha cậu nói: "Ai làm vỡ dù chỉ một thứ sẽ thua."

Cha cậu sử dụng Thiên Ma Thần Công (Heavenly Demon Divine Art), tạo áp lực lớn lên cậu. Cha cậu rút Thiên Ma Kiếm (Heavenly Demon Sword) và giao đấu với cậu, nhưng kiềm chế sức mạnh. Ông muốn cậu học cách kiểm soát sức mạnh của mình. Sau ba lần điều chỉnh, hai người giao chiến. Cậu tập trung cao độ để không vượt quá sức mạnh đã định.

Cậu nhận ra rằng tất cả những trận đánh trước đây của cậu đều bị hạn chế, nhưng lần này cậu được tự do thể hiện hết khả năng. Càng đánh, cậu càng thích nghi nhanh hơn. Sau đó, cha cậu tăng độ khó bằng cách yêu cầu cậu không được chạm vào bất cứ thứ gì trong quán. Cậu phải di chuyển giữa bàn ghế, tránh đòn tấn công của cha mà không được chạm vào chúng.

Cuối cùng, họ giao chiến trong khi bảo vệ cả những chiếc đèn lồng treo trên tường. Cậu ngăn ngọn lửa tắt vì gió kiếm. Cha cậu phóng Hắc Khí (Black Spirit) với sức mạnh kiềm chế, và cậu cũng đáp trả bằng Hắc Ma Kiếm (Black Demon Sword) của mình. Cậu gần như đạt đến trạng thái xuất thần và chiến đấu hết mình.

Trận đấu kết thúc với việc cả hai cùng thu kiếm. Không có gì bị vỡ hay trầy xước. Cha cậu chỉ ra rằng đầu những chiếc đũa trong hộp trước mặt cậu bị cắt đứt do kiếm khí lướt qua, và tuyên bố cậu thua cuộc.

Cha cậu khen ngợi cậu đã đạt được thành tựu lớn khi đánh bại Baek Mang-gi cùng với ác nhân. Sau đó, cậu xin cha chỉ dẫn về con đường võ học của mình. Cha cậu khuyên cậu nên tập trung vào Phong Thần Sát Bộ (Wind God Sabo), vì ông đã gặp phải bế tắc khi luyện tập nó. Ông tin rằng dù ông không thể vượt qua giới hạn của mình, cậu vẫn có thể đạt đến thành tựu lớn. Ông giải thích rằng đó là do Cửu Thiên Ma Công (Nine Fire Demonic Skill) gây ra, và nếu cậu học nó trước, cậu sẽ không thể thành công với Phong Thần Sát Bộ.

Trước khi rời đi, cha cậu bảo cậu khi nào rảnh thì đến chơi cờ vây.

Sau đó, cậu đến gặp Hyeolcheon Doma (Bloodthirsty Horse) và đưa cho hắn một loại thuốc bổ. Cậu nói rằng thuốc này thực chất là cho cha cậu, nhưng do cậu lấy được từ ma đầu nên hắn cứ yên tâm dùng. Khi cậu chuẩn bị rời đi, Hyeolcheon Doma hỏi tại sao cậu lại tốt với hắn như vậy. Cậu trả lời rằng cậu đối xử tốt với hắn vì hắn đã tốt với cậu, và vì cậu nghĩ hắn sẽ hữu ích hơn ba người còn lại.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-134/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-136/)Episode 135: You’re not going to fight in a tavern for the rest of your life?




“How did you come here?”


My father answered my question with what he always said.


“I stopped by while passing by.”


How could that be? My father was aware of the movements of the demons, and he must have heard that I was gathering with the four demons.


What was your state of mind? Where did you see and hear it from?


I became very close to my father, but I wasn’t yet comfortable asking him such sensitive questions.


“This is my first time with Amazon Net.”


“How was it?”


“If my father hadn’t come, I would have gone to see him as soon as I left the tavern. I would have gone to ask him how I should deal with and deal with the demons in the future. Ah, I shouldn’t make it a habit to ask my father for answers whenever I feel frustrated.”


At my half-sincere, half-flattering complaint, he would have just laughed it off and swallowed it, but today, for some reason, he said something. Those words also touched my heart.




“You can worry about that in ten years or so.”


“Will you accept me for the next ten years?”


My father’s laughter came out at this moment.


“Didn’t you know it would be this hard?”


“I didn’t know.”


“I thought you knew everything when you were so excited about keeping order.”


“If I had known, I wouldn’t have said that. The way you look from outside is different, the way you treat me is different, and when you get involved with other people, it’s different again.”


I intentionally made more death sounds. The more I struggled, the more my father liked it.


“That’s right. I became weak.”


“It’s gotten a lot better than before.”




Even when I returned and went hunting with my father, it was different from now.


While they were talking like that, a small table was set with drinks.


His father ordered the strongest liquor from the bar to be brought over for a simple stir-fried vegetable dish. Cho Chun-bae must have stir-fried the vegetables with all the skill he could muster.


“Let’s have a drink.”


I had a drink with my father.


“Oh, it’s poisonous.”


“You drink alcohol and have no fear, so why are you afraid of this poisonous drink?”


“He was a nice person, wasn’t he?”


“It’s amazing that you’re still alive, even though you have such an eye for people.”


What kind of person does his father think of Chwima?




“What kind of person is Chwima?”


“He is a person who likes to make fun of others while laughing and having fun. So, it is better not to open his bottle of alcohol without caution.”


“They say that what the adults say is true, and they also said that the Bloodthirsty Horse is a sinister person, so be careful.”


“You don’t know how sinister you are.”


I burst out laughing at my father’s words. Later, when I saw the Bloodthirsty Horse, I thought I should make fun of it.


He asked his father as he poured him a drink.


“Have you ever had a drink with just your partner?”


“there is.”


“How does Chuma act towards his father?”


“He doesn’t talk much to me.”


“Is that the drunkard who talks so much?”


That was just a joke. I think she would have talked more and acted coy in front of her father.


“Is it because you think you can’t fool your father anyway?”


“I don’t know. How can I know what’s on his mind?”


“That makes me even more curious.”


“Things that are originally poisonous tend to be flashy.”


He was saying not to be fooled by the drunkard for no reason.


“Don’t try to dig into people’s minds. Just judge them by what they see. That way, you make fewer mistakes.”


“Yes. I will keep that in mind.”


I emptied my glass with my father. I filled my glass again and asked my father.




“What do you talk about when you drink with your brother?”


“Why do you ask that?”


“I was just curious. Aren’t you going to teach me all my weaknesses?”


“It’s a weakness that anyone can see, so is there really a need to tell you?”


“What is my weakness?”


“That cheap sentiment that’s perfect for dying.”


I laughed heartily.


“I live my life thinking of it as my strength. If I’m going to do it, let’s have fun and enjoy it. The road ahead is long and rough anyway. Let’s not threaten, tie up, and kill. Let’s have fun.”


“Do you think fun is suitable for our work? You’ll die trying to find fun.”


Father, I can search for it. The fire weapon has never left my mind for a moment. I can’t sleep even when I lie down. When I think of the fire weapon dying again, I jump up and run to the training ground.


“Father, please live a more enjoyable and cheerful life now.”


“Once the authority and fear of the Heavenly Demon disappears, they will come against us with their own inconsistent agreements.”


Suddenly, it occurred to me that my father might not be able to sleep at night like he did. Maybe I shouldn’t be fooled by his floral pajamas.


“I will try to become stronger.”


“You should have gotten stronger already. Then, today’s meeting with the demons will have meaning.”

“Please teach me a trick in that regard.”


After my last fight with my father, I had achieved martial arts again. Now, my fight with my father will have a great stimulus and influence on my martial arts studies.


Father got up from his seat and stood in the space next to the table.


“Here?”


“Are you going to never fight in a bar for the rest of your life?”


“That’s not it. If we fight in this narrow space, everything will fall apart.”


Then my father said something unexpected.


“Who fights like a band of sewers, smashing everything? The one who breaks even one thing loses.”


The idea was to fight without destroying any of the objects here.


I looked around where we were. It was narrower than the first floor and had a low ceiling. It was filled with tables and chairs.


You’re going to fight your father here? Without breaking anything? Seriously, this is going to be the hardest fight you’ve ever done.


I looked down at the first floor. Since my father had sent everyone out and closed the door, only Jo Chun-bae was in the tavern.


“Sir, please go into the kitchen for a moment.”


“yes!”


“No matter what happens, don’t be surprised!”


“I was so surprised today that I don’t have any more room in my heart to be surprised.”


Jo Chun-bae hurried into the kitchen.


I stood facing my father three or four steps away.


“Did you say it was hard?”


“yes.”




“That’s because I’m weak.”


When my father began to pray, I felt out of breath. My father’s prayer, which was difficult even for the Cheonmahosingong to handle, was as heavy as Mt. Taishan, as stuffy as a swamp, and as sharp as a blade.


Father slowly pulled out the Heavenly Demon Sword.


“A Heavenly Horse must be someone who can kill when he wants to kill. The only reason someone is alive in front of me is because I saved their life.”


visor!


The Heavenly Demon Sword and the Black Demon Sword clashed in the air. The speed was the same, but the power in the swords was restrained.


visor!


The swords clashed again in the air. I could tell. My father was speaking with the power of his sword.


This power is the standard.


He was telling us to fight with just this power, as if tuning an instrument.


This fight is not one where you lose because you are weaker than your opponent. It is one where you lose because you fail to control your strength.


visor!


There were only three tunings.


Champ champ champ champ champ champ!


The Heavenly Demon Sword and the Black Demon Sword clashed splendidly.


I swung my sword only with the power I promised. Originally, each type of herb had its own power, so ignoring that power and fighting only with my current power was something that required a great deal of concentration and mental energy.


At this moment, I did not put any limits on my skills.


Since the regression, all the fights have been restricted.


You just have to show this much of your skills.


But now I fought without that kind of consciousness. I had the confidence that I could show my skills.




You told me not to trust people, but at least my father does.


I fought to my heart’s content, and I fought freely. It was a fight possible because I was a father.


The more I fought, the more quickly my body adapted to fighting.


Then my father escalated the fighting.


Now, the fight has changed from not breaking anything to not touching anything at all.


I had to move between the table and the chair to avoid my father’s attacks, without touching them? That was the best concentration I could muster.


The clash between us that took place in the meantime was beautiful. The sword lines drawn between the table and the chair were like memories drawn by a painter who had only painted pictures all his life, and the sound of swords clashing between the liquor bottles was like the sorrowful sorrow of an old musician. Then, paper was torn, and the strings of instruments were snapped.


As time went on, the fighting became more intense and the restrictions became more severe.


In the final stage, he fought while guarding even the lanterns hanging on the wall. He prevented the fire from being extinguished by the wind caused by the sword.


And then at some point.


Shhhh!


My father’s black spirit flew in.


It was a sword energy released with restrained power. If the internal energy had been properly applied here, the tavern would have been blown away in one move.


My black magic sword also sang with sword energy. Like my father, my sword energy, imbued with restrained internal energy, dissipated my father’s sword energy from the air.


Paaang!


The wind was blowing and the lamp was about to go out, so I jumped up and stopped it. It swayed dangerously, but it did not go out.


Black energy flew in one after another,


If you miss even one, the sword energy will fly backwards and break the wall. Does that mean the person who fired the sword energy loses? No. In this case, the person who misses the sword energy loses the fight.


I was almost in a state of ecstasy and fought with my father.


There was a lot of noise.




The sound of footsteps, the sound of the wind, the sound of a sword cutting through the wind, the sound of swords clashing, the sound of sword energy being released, the sound of sword energy dissipating, the sound of clothes fluttering, the sound of a lamp swaying. Each and every sound contains the essence of martial arts.


I will definitely be able to replay this fight. I didn’t have to memorize it on purpose. Every move was perfect, and the situation was dire. It was a series of moves that I will never forget, so this fight will always be a source of learning for me.


So the fight ended and we both put our swords away at the same time. The Heavenly Demon Sword and the Black Demon Sword both went into their scabbards at the same time, making a pleasant sound.


I looked around and saw that not a single chair had fallen over. There wasn’t a single scratch on the wall.


“It’s a draw!”


“No, you lost.”


My father came over and showed me the chopstick holder on the table in front of me. The tips of the chopsticks that were stuck in it were cut off.


“Ah, it’s a mark where my sword energy brushed against you. When did you see this before?”


I looked at the chopstick case on the table where my father had been sitting and sighed.


“I lost!”


I lost, but it wasn’t a losing game. My father was truly amazed and impressed by my skills.


“When I heard that you and the evil one had killed Baek Mang-gi, I guessed it. You had accomplished something great.”


You probably didn’t know it would be this bad.


My father must have been greatly inspired by me.


“What should I do now?”


I asked for directions. Where should my martial arts go? To the only person who could give me the answer.


“From now on, focus solely on training in the Wind God Sabo.”


It was my father’s conclusion. And there was a reason for that conclusion.


“I stopped practicing Fengshensabo.”


“Why did you stop?”




My father spoke honestly to me, who was surprised.


“I hit a wall.”


“If my father has reached his limit, I will never be able to overcome it.”


My father looked at me for a moment and then shook his head.


“Even if I can’t overcome it, you can achieve greatness.”


“What does it mean?”


“It is a wall created by the Nine Fire Demonic Skill. If you had learned the Nine Fire Demonic Skill first, you would not have been able to achieve the great success of the Wind God Sabo.”


“ah!”


I could see what it meant. There are compatibility issues in martial arts. There are martial arts that don’t fit together in the first place, and depending on what you learn first, there are cases where you can’t achieve great success.


“If you don’t achieve greatness before learning the art of the Nine-Handed Demon, you will never be able to achieve it after learning it.”


“I will definitely achieve greatness before then.”


When the Wind God Sabo reaches great success, it will combine with the Twelve Stars of the Flying Sword Technique to show another achievement. Later, when it is combined with the Nine Flower Demonic Arts, it will show even greater effects.


My father stared at me for a moment and then asked.


“Are you still having a hard time?”


“Thanks to your teachings, I gained confidence.”


“Do you still intend to be a cheerful celestial horse?”


“I want to live with a smile.”


My father stared at me for a moment, then turned around without saying a word. Then, when he had come down the first floor, he blurted out something nonchalantly.


“When you have time, come play some baduk.”


Jo Chun-bae, who was hiding under the counter, bowed with his back bent and looked up at me.


“Don’t worry, nothing is broken.”


Wouldn’t the magic I pursue be the magic that all the tavern owners in the world would like the most?


Jo Chun-bae said with a sigh of relief.


“The long day is coming to an end.”


\* \* \*


Jo Chun-bae’s day is over, but my day is not over.


I went to see Hyeolcheon Doma. He was sitting by the window reading a book. I thought he would be swinging his sword in anger, but he was calmer than I thought.


“You’re not practicing martial arts today.”


“Why did you come?”


“I came because I wanted to see you, sir.”


Before I brought up what happened at the tavern earlier, I handed over what I had brought first. That wasn’t what I came here to talk about.


“What is this?”


“It’s a health tonic.”


“Tonic?”


The blood clot was startled.


“You’ve become thinner since I first met you. This medicine will stimulate your appetite and nourish your body. I obtained it through the devil’s urination, so you can trust its effectiveness.”


Bloodthirsty Horse was embarrassed. He was even more embarrassed than when he had previously been given the poisonous liquor as a birthday present.


“I’ll bring you the leader.”


“He is the kind of person who suspects that I have been poisoned and orders me to eat everything right in front of him.”


Bloodthirsty Horse burst into laughter at my joke that wasn’t really a joke.


I spoke in a whisper, my voice lowered.


“This is actually for my father, but I got it from the devil. You know, right? My father takes great care of his health. So don’t worry about it and eat it.”


As I was walking out like that, Hyeolcheon Doma asked me from behind.


“Why are you so good to me?”


He looked back at him and said.


“I’m being nice to you because you’ve been nice to me. I’m being nice to you because I think you’ll be more helpful than the other three Amazons. I’m being so selfish and calculating. Then, go to sleep. And make sure to take your medicine. I’ll check with Inspector Seo!”


I nodded and turned around to face him, who was staring at me with deep eyes.


You should do it when you can, because if you don’t do it now when it comes to mind, there will be no next time.


Finally, my long day was over. I was starting to feel tipsy late in the day.
