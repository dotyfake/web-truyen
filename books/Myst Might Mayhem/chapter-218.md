 Chapter 218 – Craftsman (2)


 -Through the gaps in the mask, I noticed that person’s eyes were blue.


 -What? Blue eyes?


 Blue eyes.


 It refers to someone with blue irises while also signifying a person from the Western Regions.


 People from the Western Regions live to the west of the Central Plains.


 Although there was a considerable distance between the vendor stalls in the square and the pavilion at the back behind the main gate, Mok Gyeong-un, who had reached the Transformation Realm and possessed more developed senses than ordinary people, noticed the blue eyes showing through the gaps in the mask.


 -Are you certain?


 -The eye area of the mask protrudes, so it was dark inside and not very visible, but my eyes could see it.


 -Hmm. That’s quite peculiar. This isn’t Tibet or Xinjiang, so it’s strange to have someone from the Western Regions as an imperial official.


 This was more than just a rare occurrence.


 Although there had been much openness and exchange with martial artists recently, the imperial palace was still more closed-off and conservative than any other group.


 This was because the Han people prided themselves as the center of the Central Plains in this nation.


 

 They even arrested all those associated with the Baihwa Religion, which originated from the Western Regions, accusing them of deceiving the world and the people, and exterminated their families.


 In the imperial palace of such a nation, employing someone from the Western Regions as an official, not even a slave, was quite extraordinary.


 -There must be a reason for it.


 -That’s a carefree response. But the mere fact that someone from the Western Regions who has cultivated martial arts is in the imperial palace’s Embroidered Uniform Guards warrants caution. Try not to get entangled with them.


 -I’ll keep that in mind.


 In any case, their purpose here was singular.


 It was to abduct Fire Faith Order Holy Guardian, who was said to be imprisoned in the underground Golden Jade of the imperial palace.


 Regardless of their background or motives, it had nothing to do with him.


 As they followed the hairy man’s guidance, pig pens emitting a strong odor of livestock feces came into view.


 The squealing sounds were deafening.


 The hairy man led them inside the pens without stopping.


 At this, the Demon-Subduing monk Ja Geum-jeong muttered with a frown.


 “Don’t tell me we’re really here to slaughter pigs?”


 Mong Mu-yak shook his head and said to him.


 “If you don’t know anything, just follow along.”


 “So you’re telling me to keep my mouth shut? Hmph.”


 “Tsk tsk.”


 Mong Mu-yak clicked his tongue in displeasure.


 As they walked through the pens, the hairy man stopped at an empty pen.


 He then used a fork to push aside the pile of straw there.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c4f98310f240f4d43d687", id: "pf-8947-1"}) Underneath, there was a wooden entrance.


 The hairy man grabbed the rusty shackle on the entrance and pulled.


 -Screech!


 As the door opened, stairs leading underground were revealed.


 Seeing this, Seop Chun remarked with admiration.


 “They sure made a place like this.”


 Who would have imagined a secret underground passage hidden inside a pig pen filled with the stench of feces?


 The hairy man grinned and pointed downwards with his thumb.


 “Follow me.”


 With that, they descended the stairs.


 After descending to a depth equivalent to two floors, a cavity about ten-feet wide came into view.


 Inside the cavity, which was lit by lanterns, there were various tools and a workspace.


 The hairy man pointed to a reception chair on one side of the workshop and said.


 “The craftsman will be here soon, so please wait a moment…”


 -Tatatatatak!


 Before he could finish his sentence, someone hurriedly descended the stairs and rushed towards the hairy man.


 Judging by the blood-stained leather apron he was wearing, he seemed to be a worker from the slaughterhouse.


 “Brother Song, a word with you.”


 At his words, the hairy man asked for Mok Gyeong-un’s group’s understanding.


 “Please wait a moment.”


 Gan-yang nodded, indicating not to mind it.


 The worker and the hairy man then moved a short distance away from them and engaged in a whispered conversation.


 Although they spoke in low voices, Mok Gyeong-un, whose hearing had become more developed as his martial arts improved, could hear their conversation clearly.


 “We’re in trouble.”


 “What’s the trouble?”


 “The person who requested the production last time seems to have been an official.”


 “What?”


 “So we need to have these people wait for a while.”


 At their whispers, Mok Gyeong-un’s eyes narrowed.


 It seemed they had encountered some problem.


 Just then, the hairy man approached them, bowed his head in apology, and said.


 “I apologize for the inconvenience, but could you please wait here for a moment? The craftsman may be a little late due to an urgent delivery.”


 “Why would that be a problem? We’ll wait then.”


 Gan-yang spoke in an understanding tone.


 In any case, they were in the position of making a request, so they couldn’t complain.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c50524a5a770dd7e4e350", id: "pf-8948-1"}) As the slaughterhouse workers who had asked for their understanding went outside, Gan-yang glanced at Mok Gyeong-un and the rear team and said.


 “It won’t take long.”


 At this, the Demon-Subduing monk Ja Geum-jeong interjected.


 “Who knows? Will it really be so?”


 “Pardon?”


 “I heard those guys talking earlier about some officials. Didn’t you hear?”


 It seemed Ja Geum-jeong had also overheard their conversation.


 Gan-yang asked back.


 “Officials?”


 “Yeah. The lord mentioned seeing the Embroidered Uniform Guards earlier. Isn’t that who they were referring to?”


 At his words, Gan-yang stroked his chin, looking troubled.


 The Embroidered Uniform Guards had simply come to inspect the meat to be delivered to the imperial palace and take it.


 But he couldn’t fathom what this was about.


 Seop Chun said to him.


 “If something happens to the craftsman, won’t it hinder our mission?”


 “That’s…”


 “Didn’t you say this person is the only one who can create the human skin masks within the time frame?”


 “…That’s right.”


 The purpose of their visit was to commission the creation of human skin masks.


 Human skin masks refer to leather masks made using human skin or pig hide that are indistinguishable from real human faces.


 The owner of Hong Bong Meat here was known for slaughtering livestock on the surface, but in the underworld, he had a high reputation for crafting extremely sophisticated human skin masks.


 Of course, not many in the martial arts world were aware of this.


 “But even so, as the Demon-Subduing monk said, if those officials are from the Embroidered Uniform Guards, it’s best for us not to intervene.”


 “What a coincidence on this day of all days. Dammit!”


 It was truly an uncanny coincidence.


 Since they needed to infiltrate the Embroidered Uniform Guards, it was best not to cause friction with them right away.


 If they stirred up trouble and it affected the Guard Trials, everything would be for naught.


 “Let’s wait for now. It’s not like we have an alternative plan.”


 At Mok Gyeong-un’s words, everyone nodded in agreement.


 About an hour passed.


 Just then, the sound of the secret underground door opening came from above, and someone descended.


 They thought it might be the craftsman, but it wasn’t.


 The one who came down was the hairy man who had guided them.


 However, unlike before, the hairy man’s complexion and expression didn’t look good.


 Gan-yang spoke.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) “Is the craftsman not here yet?”


 “I apologize for the wait, but I’m afraid I have even more regrettable news for you.”


 “What do you mean?”


 “The craftsman is currently unable to accept any requests.”


 “Unable to accept requests?”


 Gan-yang raised his voice.


 The hairy man then bowed his head and spoke in a groveling tone.


 “I’m sorry, but I cannot disclose the circumstances. So, I kindly ask the guests to please leave.”


 “What? You’re telling us to leave now?”


 Gan-yang looked dumbfounded and abruptly stood up from his seat.


 Startled, the hairy man flinched and took half a step back.


 Gan-yang pressed him.


 “Are you violating the rule of accepting requests from those who bring the token? Moreover, didn’t we wait here despite arriving first, considering your circumstances?”


 “Ah, I’m aware of that. However, we truly cannot accept any requests at the moment. Even if you threaten my life…”


 At that moment, Mok Gyeong-un spoke up.


 “I smell blood.”


 ‘!?’


 At his words, everyone looked at him in surprise.


 Mok Gyeong-un pointed at the hairy man’s hand with his index finger and said.


 “That hand.”


 The hairy man furrowed his brows at those words.


 What was he saying about smelling blood from this distance? He wasn’t a dog or anything.


 The hairy man waved his hands and said.


 “Naturally, there’s the smell of blood since our job is slaughtering…”


 “No. It’s not the smell of cattle or pig blood but human blood.”


 “Th-that’s…”


 “It’s not just that. Judging by the scent of dried purple orchids and large knotweed mixed with the blood, it seems you hastily applied a hemostatic.”


 At these words, the hairy man’s eyes widened.


 He was already skeptical when Mok Gyeong-un mentioned the smell of blood, but now he was mentioning purple orchids and large knotweed, leaving him perplexed.


 Both herbs were hemostatics used in slaughterhouses.


 Occasionally, cuts occurred during the slaughter work, and those herbs were used at such times.


 But he had smelled it even though it was mixed with the scent of blood?


 The startled hairy man spoke in a trembling voice.


 “…How did you know that?”


 “Ah. I’ve studied herbs a little.”


 ‘A little?’


 At those words, everyone looked at Mok Gyeong-un with surprise.


 Was it possible to do this by simply studying herbs a little?


 Even in this underground room, the smell of leather and metal was mixed, making it difficult to detect other scents.


 Yet, Mok Gyeong-un had distinguished the scent of blood and herbs from the hairy man’s hand, which was astonishing.


 Just then, the hairy man suddenly approached Mok Gyeong-un, knelt down, and said.


 “D-Do you perhaps know medicine as well?”


 “Medicine?”


 As Mok Gyeong-un asked back, the hairy man, who had even lowered his head, pleaded in a desperate voice.


 “Please help us!”


 \*\*\*


 A building located between the pig and cattle pens.


 “Ugh…”


 Inside a room in the building, a middle-aged man in his fifties wearing a shaggy leather outfit was suffering in agony with a pale face.


The sourc𝗲 of this content is frёeωebɳovel.com.

 That was because both of his wrists had been severed.


 The slaughterhouse workers beside him had tightly wrapped cloth above his severed wrists to stop the bleeding, but the blood didn’t seem to clot easily.


 One of the workers said to the man, who was in pain.


 “Master, please endure a little longer. The doctor will arrive soon.”


 “Haa… haa… but… my daughter…”


 “Young master Mo has gone to bring the young miss back immediately.”


 “Hurry and bring my daughter first… ugh.”


 “Please calm down. It will be serious if you continue like this.”


 The workers tried to dissuade him as he attempted to get up despite his agony from his severed wrists.


 Just then, the door opened, and six men, led by the hairy man, rushed into the room.


 They were Mok Gyeong-un’s group.


 One of the workers abruptly stood up and shouted.


 “No, Brother Song. What is the meaning of this? Why did you bring the guests here?”


 The hairy man pointed to the middle-aged man, who was referred to as the master, and said to Mok Gyeong-un.


 “The master’s severed wrists are not clotting. We have called for a doctor, but something might happen before then. Please help us.”


 “Wait, what is going on here?”


 Gan-yang was dumbfounded as he witnessed this.


 What on earth had happened for the master’s arms to be severed like that?


 Seeing this, Seop Chun and Mong Mu-yak simultaneously looked at Mok Gyeong-un.


 That was because, although they didn’t know the details, Mok Gyeong-un had previously used his techniques to reattach Mong Mu-yak’s severed arm.


 So they glanced at him with a glimmer of hope.


 -Step step!


 At that moment, Mok Gyeong-un approached the master.


 The workers beside him tried to block the way with a guarded look in their eyes.


 The hairy man, called Brother Song, scolded them.


 “Don’t interfere! He’s here to help.”


 At those words, the hesitant workers stepped aside.


 Mok Gyeong-un then approached the suffering master and quickly pressed the acupuncture points on both of his arms.


 -Tatatatatak!


 As he pressed the hemostatic points, the blood seeping from the cloth-wrapped severed area noticeably stopped.


 The master, who had been in agony, looked at Mok Gyeong-un with a surprised expression.


 “Haa… haa… who… are you?”


 “Let’s talk about that later. Where are the severed hands?”


 Mok Gyeong-un looked around and asked.


 That was because he couldn’t see the master’s severed hands.


 Instead of the master, one of the workers beside him slammed the table and spoke in an angry voice.


 -Bang!


 “Those bastards took the master’s severed hands wrapped in leather.”


 “They took the severed hands?”


 Mok Gyeong-un showed a troubled expression at those words.


 Just then, the master, who seemed to be able to endure a bit after the bleeding had stopped, spoke with difficulty.


 “G-Guests, I don’t know who you are, but please leave. I’m in no condition to accept any requests or help anyone…”


 “Who are the ones that took the severed hands?”


 “What’s the point of asking that…”


 “If you want to save your hands, it’s best to tell me.”


 At Mok Gyeong-un’s words, the master and the workers showed incomprehensible expressions.


 How could they possibly save the already severed hands?


 As they were puzzled, the hairy man, referred to as Brother Song, spoke to Mok Gyeong-un with a troubled look.


 “The ones who severed the master’s hands and took them away are from the Embroidered Uniform Guards. I apologize, but even if you follow them, you won’t be able to retrieve the hands.”


 “Damn it!”


 Seop Chun cursed at the hairy man’s words.


 As he suspected, it was the Embroidered Uniform Guards.


 If the Embroidered Uniform Guards, the imperial palace guards, had severed the hands of the master, no, the craftsman who was supposed to make the human skin masks, there was no way to do anything about it right away.


 Just then, Mok Gyeong-un turned around.


 “My lord?”


 Mong Mu-yak called out to him in confusion.


 Mok Gyeong-un shook his head and said.


 “There’s no other way. I’ll be back soon, so please wait here.”


 “Pardon? But my lord…”


 -Swish!


 Before he could finish his sentence, Mok Gyeong-un’s figure dispersed like smoke and disappeared from their sight.


 The master and the workers’ eyes widened at the sight.


 \*\*\*


 Although Hong Bong Meat was a large-scale slaughterhouse, it was located on the southwestern outskirts of the city due to the nature of slaughter work.


 The outskirts were surrounded by forests, making it relatively less frequented by people.


 -Rumble rumble!


 A procession of carts loaded with meat was proceeding there, and at the very back, there was a carriage and four Embroidered Uniform Guards in navy blue flying fish robes riding horses side by side as if escorting it.


 Among them, an Embroidered Uniform Guards with droopy eyebrows riding on the right side clicked his tongue and said.


 “What a foolish wench.”


 The Embroidered Uniform Guards with a beard riding next to him said.


 “Indeed. No matter how much they are her father’s hands, it’s quite daring of her to chase after us and make a fuss.”


 “She has no sense.”


 “Understandable. What child wouldn’t be distraught over their parent’s plight?”


 “Well, that’s true.”


 “But I wonder how the Thousand-men Commander will deal with that wench. His Excellency personally ordered us to bring the severed hands, so it’s unlikely he’ll return them.”


 As he spoke, the bearded Embroidered Uniform Guards glanced at the carriage.


 Inside that carriage were the Thousand-men Commander and that wench.


 Just then…


 The carriage that had been following the cart procession suddenly came to a halt.


 “Huh?”


 Wondering what was happening, the Embroidered Uniform Guards steered their horses to the side to look at the front of the cart procession.


 There, someone with their face covered in black cloth stood with their hands behind their back.


 The Embroidered Uniform Guards with droopy eyebrows, dumbfounded, rode his horse to the front of the cart procession, drew his sword, and shouted.


 -Sreung!


 “Who dares to block the way of the procession?”


 

  In response to his shout, the person with the covered face chuckled and said.


 “How foolish of you.”


 “What?”


 “If I were going to tell you, why would I have covered my face?”


 “You insolent bastard!”


 -Pat!


 Enraged, the Embroidered Uniform Guards with droopy eyebrows immediately leaped off his horse and swung his sword with fierce momentum towards the person with the covered face.


 However…


 -Clang!


 His blade was blocked by the index finger of the person with the covered face.


 Having his blade blocked by a mere finger, the Embroidered Uniform Guards with droopy eyebrows was so surprised that he couldn’t hide his bewilderment.


 ‘A-An expert!’
