# Absolute Regression Chapter 186 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Sau màn thể hiện sức mạnh kiếm thuật áp đảo của Lee Gongja (Geommu-geuk), các thành viên Hắc Quyền (Black Fist) vừa kinh sợ vừa ngưỡng mộ cậu. Kwon Ma (Kwon-ma) cũng cảm nhận được sức mạnh thần thánh đó. Cheon So-hee chất vấn Gongja về việc cậu đã mạnh mẽ như vậy thì còn học võ làm gì, phải chăng chỉ là trò vui. Gongja đáp rằng cậu muốn lấp đầy khoảng trống khi tay không tấc sắt, hoặc khi không kịp lấy kiếm.

Đêm đó, Gongja luyện tập chăm chỉ các kỹ thuật cơ bản. Kwon Ma đến gặp cậu, nói rằng dù Gongja có cố gắng gấp mười lần, hắn cũng không nhận cậu làm đệ tử. Gongja đoán rằng Kwon Ma muốn giao đấu với mình, nhưng cậu từ chối vì muốn học võ từ hắn. Cậu muốn Kwon Ma tự nguyện so tài, chứ không phải vì tranh giành quyền lực.

Gongja hỏi Kwon Ma rằng hắn muốn chiến đấu hay muốn chiến thắng, ám chỉ rằng Kwon Ma quá quen với việc chiến thắng nên không nhận ra sự khác biệt. Gongja gợi lại lời ác ma Soma (evil Soma) rằng chỉ khi Kwon Ma thất bại, người ta mới hiểu rõ con người hắn. Gongja đề nghị Kwon Ma dạy võ trước, rồi sau đó sẽ giao đấu. Kwon Ma bỏ đi, nhưng Gongja tin rằng, Kwon Ma sẽ không thể chờ đợi lâu hơn cậu.

Hôm sau, Gongja vẫn luyện tập như thường lệ. Các thành viên Hắc Quyền cũng đến với tinh thần mới. Thậm chí có người còn nói "Tôi đã được tái sinh ngày hôm qua". Một vài người bắt đầu hỏi xin Gongja lời khuyên. Không khí trong Hắc Quyền đã thay đổi chỉ sau một ngày.

Sau buổi tập, Cheon So-hee tìm đến Gongja để thực hiện lời hứa sau khi thua cược. Cậu yêu cầu cô nhận cậu làm đệ tử. Cheon So-hee ngạc nhiên vì Kwon Ma còn chưa chọn đệ tử chính thức. Gongja nói rằng nếu cô nhận cậu làm đệ tử, cơ hội cô trở thành đệ tử của cậu sẽ tăng lên, và cậu sẽ tiến cử cô làm đệ tử thứ tư của mình. Gongja tin rằng cô phù hợp nhất để trở thành Kwon Ma tiếp theo.

Đêm đó, Cheon So-hee trằn trọc không ngủ. Lời nói của Gongja cứ văng vẳng trong đầu cô. Cuối cùng, cô đến khu nhà của Gongja và thấy cậu đang luyện tập. Sau khi Gongja tập xong, cô hỏi liệu cậu có thực sự tiến cử cô làm sư đệ nếu cô nhận cậu làm đệ tử. Gongja khẳng định điều đó. Cô phân vân, vì từ trước đến nay cô luôn nghĩ rằng không nên tin bất cứ ai trong giới võ thuật.

Gongja nói rằng mục tiêu của cậu là học võ của Kwon Ma tiền nhiệm, và người kế vị Kwon Ma sẽ là sư đệ của cậu. Cô lo sợ bị lợi dụng. Gongja trấn an cô bằng một câu nói bất ngờ: "Cuộc sống không dễ dàng, phải không?". Cô bật khóc, thừa nhận rằng cuộc sống không hề dễ dàng. Ngay lúc đó, một người phụ nữ bước vào và trêu chọc Gongja.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-185/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-187/)Episode 186: Not easy, right?




A heavy silence fell.


No one here died, but there were some who did. It was clear that the arrogance, boastfulness, and pride that the Black Fist had possessed until now had all just died.


Of course, the look in their eyes towards me changed completely. Awe, fear, anger. Each emotion was expressed according to their personality.


It was Kwon Ma who broke the silence.


“Now you know how scary swords are?”


“yes!”


The black swordsmen answered loudly.


“When I first taught you martial arts, I told you not to be afraid of the sword. But now you must know how to be afraid of the sword.”


Sometimes you shouldn’t be afraid, and sometimes you should be afraid. The lesson that Kwon-ma wanted to give his subordinates today was that they should have both of these mindsets.


“Let’s stop here for today.”




After saying that, Kwon-ma left first. Although he didn’t show his face in front of his subordinates, I could sense that he was also moved by the divine power I showed him.


The remaining black fists couldn’t disperse as usual and looked at me. There were awe-filled eyes here and there. By nature, the mines valued the strong, and they had a particularly strong desire to become strong.


Cheon So-hee asked on their behalf.


“If you’re so strong, why do you want to learn martial arts? Is this some kind of game for the strong?”


It was a very provocative question.


She was shocked by that move just a moment ago. At the same time, she was angry at herself for being so helpless. Since she doesn’t want to lose to anyone, she might be able to take the next Kwonma seat.


I asked her calmly.


“How can learning martial arts be fun?”


“But why do you want to learn?”


Why? Because I felt a desire to knock down that cliff with this fist.




“When my sword flew at you a moment ago, my two hands were empty. What if I get attacked then? What if the master doesn’t give me a chance to retrieve my sword? I want to learn for that moment. This punch that hits my opponent when he’s not paying attention will save me.”


Cheon So-hee stared at me intently. I wondered if she was sincere or not, but it was impossible for her, who was still young, to read my mind.


After saying that, I also left the training center.


Just as the fate of all those related to me is changing, their fates will also change in some way. I just hope that it will change for the better.


\* \* \*


That night, I was practicing martial arts.


I slowly and thoroughly practiced all the basic techniques I had learned from Baekkwon to Heukkwon. I will be able to learn Kwonma’s Dokmun Kwon method properly only after I have mastered this basic technique.


Papapapang!


I loved the sound of my fist hitting the air. I wanted to learn Kwonma’s martial arts and become a great martial artist.


“You’re working hard even though it’s late at night.”




The person who came to see me was Kwon Ma. Every time I hear it, I am surprised by the calm voice that contrasts with that scary face. What is more similar to his nature, his face or his voice?


Actually, I had a feeling that Kwon-ma would come looking for me. I thought he would definitely react to the skills I showed him earlier.


“Since I started late, I have to work twice as hard.”


“I will not accept you as my disciple even if you earn ten times as much.”


“Can I ask why?”


Kwonma didn’t answer, but the heat in his eyes spoke for him. You want to fight me. You can’t fight your disciple.


“You want to fight me, right?”


Just as he set my heart on fire, I also set his heart on fire.


“I won’t fight.”


The moment I fight him, I won’t be able to learn martial arts. There is only one way to learn martial arts from Kwon Ma. It’s a fight for succession, it’s a political issue, it’s all useless. We have to be connected through martial arts. I have to make him want to fight me, so I have to teach him. That’s my plan.


“Why don’t you fight?”


Likewise, I did not answer. Kwonma, who was staring at me, realized the meaning behind my refusal.


“You’re worried about beating me.”


A wave of emotion crossed Kwon Ma’s expression. After being given the title of undefeated, he had never experienced worrying about being defeated. Everyone had only seen him struggle to avoid being killed.


“Lee Gongja, you don’t have to worry about that. The martial arts you learned were learned from the cult leader, so it wouldn’t be shameful if I lost.”


I also looked behind his words.


“Do you want to fight? Or do you want to win?”


For a moment, Kwonma showed signs of being startled.


“Is there a difference between the two?”


It was closer to this than saying it was a statement of arrogance.




“You’re so used to winning that you don’t even notice the difference.”


He strode forward and thrust his face in front of me again. Seeing that scary face so close was truly more powerful than a flying fist.


“What are you trying to say?”


I remembered what the evil Soma had said. He said that you would only know what kind of person Kwonma was when he lost.


“If the Demon Lord is a bloodthirsty Demon Lord or an extremely evil Demon Lord, then it wouldn’t be easy for him to accept defeat as he is an undefeated Demon Lord.”


“Would I break my promise because of the shock of defeat? How can you see me!”


The expression on the undefeated horse’s face distorted into a ferocious grimace. It was so scary that it seemed as if the ground next to him would open and demons would burst out from hell.


“Please teach me martial arts first. Then I will have a match with you.”


Kwon-ma snorted with an expression that said, “That’s ridiculous.”


“You will have to fight me first.”


After saying that, Kwon-ma turned around and walked away.


Sorry, but that’s not your hand. As long as you’re crazy about martial arts, as long as you’ve built up a myth of invincibility, that hand has been mine.


I can wait, but you can’t wait.


\* \* \*


Cheon So-hee watched the sword dance performance in silence.

Despite the chaos that occurred yesterday, Geommu-geuk participated in Black Fist training as usual. He was absorbed in training as if yesterday had never happened.


But the Black Fist were different. They showed up with gold ointment applied to their sides and showed a different kind of passion than the day before.


“I was born again yesterday.”


There was even a black power that openly said such things.


Whether he was aware of these changes and disturbances or not, Geommugeuk was focusing on his training alone.


His movements were more precise than anyone else there, and he understood the first move better. Any suspicion that someone secretly taught him the first move since he was the son of the cult leader was completely dispelled by the skill displayed by Geommu Geuk yesterday.


“I have something to ask you. Is that okay?”


Just as the people of the Red Fist started to ask the Black Fist about the beginner’s guide, there were also those in the Black Fist.


“Of course.”


Geommugeuk explained sincerely what he asked.


The atmosphere of the black powers changed like this in just one day.


After training that day, Cheon So-hee went to Geommu-geuk.


“I lost the bet, so I’ll keep my promise. Just tell me what you want from me.”


Then Geommugeuk said something unexpected.


“Please make me your disciple.”


Cheon So-hee looked at Geommu-geuk with a dumbfounded expression for a moment.


“Then please make me your successor.”


I said it as a joke.


But soon she could tell from the expression on his face that he meant it.


“This is not a joke.”




“Of course I’m not joking.”


“I couldn’t even become a disciple myself, so how can I make you a disciple?”


At this time, Kwon Ma had not yet chosen a formal disciple. Kwon Ma, a perfectionist in martial arts, did not make a hasty decision about choosing a disciple.


“You should worry about that since you lost the bet.”


“I never thought you would ask such a ridiculous request.”


“Then why didn’t you tell me then? You have to put limits on your requests.”


“Well… I thought that anyone with common sense would naturally make a reasonable request.”


“Is that really so? Or maybe you didn’t tell me because you thought you’d win?”


She couldn’t argue. The words of the swordsman were true. When they made the bet to grant her a favor, she was about to say that she couldn’t make a request that was out of the ordinary. But her instincts stopped her.


It was a bet that I was sure I would win, but I didn’t think it was necessary to say that.


“Okay, I admit it.”


The swordsman smiled. If he hadn’t been so honest, he would have teased her some more.


“What do you mean by admitting something? If someone asks you such an absurd request, you should reject them harshly and forget about them.”


She looked at the sword dance for a moment, confused.


I thought he was a truly unpredictable person.


She turned around. She walked a few steps and then stopped. She had lost the bet anyway, and it was a hurt pride to leave like this. She turned around again.


“Okay, let’s say I have that ability. Even so, if you become my disciple, my chances of becoming your disciple will decrease, so how can I help you?”


“That’s wrong. If I become your disciple, the chances of you becoming my disciple will increase.”


“Why is that?”


“It was difficult to accept the first disciple, but now, as if the floodgates had opened, I will accept the third disciple. And I will strongly recommend you as my fourth disciple.”




“Me? Why?”


The swordsman stared at her and spoke calmly.


“I think you’ll do better than anyone else. I think you’re the best fit for the next Kwonma.”


I thought it was another joke, but the expression on Geommugeuk’s face was serious.


Her heart was filled with emotion. It was something she had never heard since she entered Dongkwonmun.


He, his peers, his seniors and juniors all ran looking up. He ran with the mindset that if he were to drop from the white to the black level, he would die.


Although we were all colleagues who had suffered together, she never truly said anything nice to anyone. I had never heard such words from her.


Rather, he secretly hoped that his opponent would have a harder time than he did. That his opponent would be eliminated from the competition. That way, he would become the champion.


The swordsman, who had only known me for a few days, said this without hesitation. In all the years that had passed, they had never once exchanged such words.


It wasn’t that I felt bitter because I hadn’t heard it. I felt complicated because I felt like I had confirmed my narrow-mindedness that I had never been able to share with anyone.


“even though you do not know it that well!”


She got angry and turned around and left.


\* \* \*


That night, Cheon So-hee had a hard time falling asleep.


The words of the sword dance kept coming to mind. Was I really the kind of person who would be fit for the role of a martial artist?


She couldn’t sleep and tossed and turned, so she couldn’t stand it anymore and headed to the Geommu Theater’s quarters.


I didn’t even think I’d be able to meet him since it was late at night. I just went there feeling frustrated, but surprisingly, Geommugeuk was practicing martial arts.


He couldn’t even say hello to the serious training he was doing. He just stood there, afraid of being a nuisance.


After a while, Geommu-geuk, who had finished his first round of martial arts training, sat down on a flat rock in the yard and asked.


“Would you like a cup of tea?”




“No, it’s okay.”


Cheon So-hee sat next to him. She didn’t mind the smell of sweat from the sword dance that wafted in.


“It’s late at night, but I came here because I really wanted to confirm this. If I become your disciple, will you really recommend me as your brother?”


“That will happen.”


How much should I trust? There is something I always say when I drink with my fellow Black Fist colleagues. You should never trust anyone. That is the first rule for surviving long in the martial arts world.


“My goal is to learn the martial arts of the former Kwonma. The one who will inherit the position of Kwonma will be my younger brother.”


But when the moment of such powerful temptation came, I had a hard time making a decision.


“My sister-in-law who sentenced Cheonma to death.”


Yeah, that’s why everyone gets fooled. Even though we know it’s obvious sweet talk, our hearts still pound so fast that we get fooled.


What if you’re going to use me like this? What if I’m used to my heart’s content and then I get killed and destroyed? The sword of the sword dance came to her mind. As the sword passed through her face, she’d say this. Naive girl.


Just then, Geommugeuk spoke to her in a calm tone.


“Life isn’t easy, is it?”


Those softly spoken words struck my heart.


At that moment, she wanted to scream. What on earth do you keep pretending to know about me? It’s easy, I’m doing well in my life. What could be difficult? Just keep running hard and keep running. Just look up and run.


But the words that came out of her mouth now conveyed the meaning of her heart rather than her head.


“… … It’s not easy.”


I answered like that without realizing it. I’ve never shown my weakness to anyone. I’ve never told anyone that I was having a hard time in life. I’ve just endured it well up until now.


The moment she acknowledged it, tears flowed down from Cheon So-hee’s eyes. She was even more flustered by the sudden tears. The tears flowed down suddenly without any time to hold back.


Could tears flow so suddenly? She was clearly not sad at all, so why were she crying? She was so embarrassed because she had never shed tears since she was a child.


“Oh, no, this is.”




Just as I was hurriedly wiping away my tears with my sleeve, someone came in and said.


“As expected! Detective Seo’s words about him being the world’s most playboy were right. After a fateful love affair, he’s now even making women cry.”


Looking at the person who came in, Geommu-geuk smiled brightly, and Cheon So-hee was surprised. It was the first time in her life that she had seen such a beautiful woman.
