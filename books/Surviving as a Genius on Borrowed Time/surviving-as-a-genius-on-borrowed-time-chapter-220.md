# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 220 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Chương truyện mở đầu với sự xuất hiện bất ngờ của một người đàn ông lạ mặt tại cuộc họp của sáu đại chúa tể (great lords). Hắn ta, trong bộ trang phục màu hồng không vướng chút bụi, đã dễ dàng khống chế Hạ Hầu Vĩ Tấn (Ha Hou Wei Jin), nghiền nát miệng của gã xuống sàn đá cẩm thạch.

Sự xuất hiện của kẻ lạ mặt khiến tất cả mọi người kinh ngạc. Tôn Mộc Lĩnh Chủ (Sunmoks), Thiên Sơ Sơ (Cheon Soso) mở to mắt, Uẩn Tố Vũ (Yunsoyu) rút kiếm, còn Tân Huyết Cực Ma Tần Minh Châu (Shinhyeolgeukma Jinmyeongjo) thì khoanh tay dò xét. Tần Minh Châu đề nghị hợp tác tấn công nhưng không ai đáp lời. A Sư Lẫm (Aksurim), người đang giữ Hắc Thương (black spear), cảm nhận được một luồng khí tức quen thuộc nhưng khó chịu từ kẻ xâm nhập và yêu cầu Tiên Vu Dạ (Seomye) nhìn kỹ.

Trong khi đó, Ma Quảng Ích (Ma Gwang-ik) lo lắng hỏi Tiên Vu Dạ có ổn không, nhưng cô lại tỏ ra xấu hổ và do dự. Cô cảm thấy hối hận vì đã không đi cùng ông ngoại. Tuy nhiên, đúng lúc cô định lên tiếng thì nhận được tin nhắn từ Thái Sư (Grand Master), nói rằng việc này phù hợp với bản chất phản nghịch của ông ngoại và có thể tránh được xung đột.

Ngay sau đó, các đại chúa tể đồng loạt vận công chuẩn bị tấn công. Tần Minh Châu nhận ra kẻ địch mặc giáp khí (internal energy clothing) rất kiên cố và lo lắng về sự hiện diện của Ma Quảng Ích, người mà hắn cảm thấy vô cùng áp lực.

Cuối cùng, người đàn ông mặc áo hồng ngẩng đầu lên, để lộ một khuôn mặt trẻ trung nhưng đầy vẻ dữ tợn. Hắn ta lên tiếng: "Các ngươi đang cố gắng phản lại quy tắc của vua sao?". Tần Minh Châu định đề nghị hợp tác tấn công thì tất cả mọi người, kể cả A Sư Lẫm, Thiên Sơ Sơ và Uẩn Tố Vũ đều bất động như thể chứng kiến điều không nên thấy.

A Sư Lẫm kinh ngạc nhận ra người đàn ông lạ mặt chính là ông ngoại của Tiên Vu Dạ, Mã Nguyên Chích (Ma Yeon-jeok) đã trẻ lại. "Thật sự, thật sự... điên rồi...!", A Sư Lẫm thốt lên.

Sau sự việc, mọi người tiếp tục cuộc họp trong trạng thái bàng hoàng. Mã Nguyên Chích ngồi ở vị trí chủ tọa. Hạ Hầu Vĩ Tấn sau khi tỉnh lại thì im lặng khác thường. Mã Nguyên Chích hỏi Tiên Vu Dạ muốn đi đâu, và cô đề xuất đến Tây Thục (Seomseo). Mã Nguyên Chích tuyên bố Ma Quảng Ích cũng sẽ đến Tây Thục. Cuộc họp diễn ra nhanh chóng một cách bất thường.

It was truly a shocking revelation.


The six great lords attended the meeting. There was no concern for their safety.


Because the power was close to absolute for a moment, it was difficult for anyone to deny the sense of stability.


Even in these chaotic times of survival of the fittest, we could talk about safety.


It was said that even if only three black people gathered together, they could talk about invincibility. It was not a groundless story. Even if the words of the rich people were often exaggerated, it was the same.


But.


Saaaaaaaa―


The clothes of the man who lowered his head to the floor were free of dust.


Even as the hazy dust spread around, it maintained its vivid pink color. The protective gear even covered the hem of the clothes.


It meant that there was not even a single space where water could leak in the aerodynamic force surrounding the entire body.




He is seen kneeling on one knee and pressing down on the back of Ha Hou Wei Jin’s head.


It didn’t come across realistically. I felt arrogant even though I was slightly bowing my head toward Cheonrimdaeju.


A continuous prayer flowed from my whole body. The colorless, swaying waves were truly powerful and free.


“Didn’t you ask? You truly are a worthless thing.”


It was a sound like a lion’s roar.


Xiahou Weijin was unable to answer.


That was because his mouth, which had been shouting at his new junior, was crushed to the floor. His lips were crushing the marble.


What would have happened if there were no internal armor that was always activated?


It was a blow that could have instantly destroyed the black mouth that filled even the inside of the body with aerodynamics.


“I was just listening and it was amazing. I should have come down a long time ago.”




The man spoke in a hushed tone.


There was no one to answer right away.


Wonpyeongilgeomjang is a place that is only known through rumors even in the world of martial arts.


There is no other place where so many of the black ones of the Yellow Emperor gather. It must be the most dangerous place in the world.


Until the ceiling just collapsed.


No one reacted in advance.


It was something that was very rare. It could be called a disaster.


It would not make sense if the intruder’s internal study did not reach the point of returning to the truth.


It was a state where extremes could lead to people acting ordinary.


“… … .”




There was silence for a moment.


The Lord of the Sunmoks, Cheon Soso, opened his blue eyes wide.


He was staring blankly at the man, his spirits still in the still atmosphere unique to ice rinks.


The energy that contained the secret of Jeongjung-dong was cold and powerful.


As soon as the ceiling cracked, Yunsoyu, who had been drawing her sword, aimed it at the man.


Even as the storm raged, her long black hair remained calm. She combined the clan’s abilities with swordsmanship.


He was a master who could mysteriously manipulate the wind.


Saaaa.


A sharp energy was etched into the hands of the Shinhyeolgeukma Jinmyeongjo, who was crossing his arms. Even when faced with something surprising, his expression was still.


It stood with an orphaned appearance, surrounded by irregularly spreading waves. It was the dignity unique to the Blood-Blooded Pearl.


Even though the major lords were anxious for an immediate battle, they could not come out right away.


The first thing to do was to gauge the opponent.


There is no mistaking the aura of the great lords of the city of Ip Hwang. The mighty and powerful Xiahou Wei Jin was easily subdued.


Although the advantage of surprise was great, it was not an opportunity to underestimate the opponent.


“Fit me.”


Jin Myeong-jo spoke briefly.


The words themselves were empty. The utility of combined attacks depended on the compatibility of the martial arts that had been learned. The combination of the Blood-Blooded Lord and the Great Lords of the Ming Clan was the worst.


It wasn’t about matching and talking, it was about you making the first move and I would find an opening to attack.


Cheon So-so and Un So-yu did not answer.


It was different from their usual attitude of looking down on Jinmyeongjo’s bloodline.




The intruder fooled the black masters’ senses. He completely destroyed their power.


A peerless master. It was possible to wear something that resembled even a little bit of the prayer of the nature-like Iphwangseongju.


I had to assume death and use meticulous techniques to dissect my opponent.


Aksurim, who had already lowered the window behind him, frowned slightly.


“What is this?”


She was holding the black spear with one hand. The rider’s form, with a transparent haze covering her entire body, was unusual.


An incredible amount of power surged from the spear that rose behind her slender back.


Among the martial arts of Jang Byeong-gi, the most famous one in the world is the Yue Family Spear Technique.


It was once considered one of the two greatest singing techniques in the world along with Yang Ga Chang, but it has become a thing of the past in her hands.


This was because the majesty of the Iphwangsinchang far surpassed the martial arts skills of the Yanggachang masters.


“It’s a strange and familiar vibe. It’s very unpleasant. Is it the Thirteen Heavenly Lord that I haven’t seen? If not, how could his true nature be pierced like this… … .”


Aksurim muttered. He looked at the person who was holding down Hahuwijin’s back of the head.


I couldn’t see the face of the intruder. It was because he was bowing his head toward Cheonrimdaeju as if he was scolding him.


She slowly moved her lips.


“Seomyeya, you have to look at it properly.”

The tone was filled with concern. It was because the pretty junior was ignoring the intruder.


“ah.”


The new leader, Ma Gwang-ik, gave a dry and indifferent speech. His thick eyebrows did not move at all.


The breath flowing out from under the beautiful nose is long and thin.


His Qigong breathing became surprisingly deep, and he seemed to be dazed, like someone his age. This was extremely rare.


Ip Hwang-shin-chang’s field of vision was wide. He could confirm Seomye’s appearance without having to look away. He couldn’t help but ask worriedly.


“Are you okay?”


“Evil senior.”


The junior lifted his head. He had his head tilted down.


“Why? Tell me.”


Aksurim urged him gently. His words and actions were gentle even when facing a formidable enemy.


He was truly a great senior.


“that is…….”


At this moment, Jeong Yeon-shin was alone and detached. Her heart was like that. Her face, which was trying to hide her expression, showed great shame.


It was a feeling that only I knew. A strange and homeless shame came over me like a cloud. It was accompanied by a great regret. I should have come with you instead.


‘ah…….’


I had to say it anyway.


It seemed that his maternal grandfather had no intention of revealing his identity. He was busy pressing the back of Xiahou Weijin’s head.


It was the behavior of a veteran who was completely blocked from both sides.


Was it because he was so angry that he didn’t even feel like looking around? And yet, the supreme prayer that didn’t allow him to approach was amazing.




There should never be a case where black seniors come out first.


The purple master collides with four black masters? Only they can pierce through steel with a single throw.


Regardless of winning or losing, the results were not going to be good.


Jeongyeonshin can stop her grandfather. However, she cannot stop the moment when Paehyeop extends his hand.


If things got any worse here, it would be difficult for me to attend the Wonpyeongil Prosecutor’s Office in the future. I wouldn’t be able to show my face.


‘no.’


Although it was difficult, I was able to overcome my shame and stand up.


And then it was time to open my mouth.


-Please wait a moment.


It was the Grand Master’s message.


Jeong Yeon-shin turned her gaze. She immediately saw the Grand General. He was smiling.


The lines on his thick beard gave him a very cheerful disposition. It was a sight that was difficult to understand.


The Grand General continued his speech.


―After being summoned to the palace, you will have to live as a dark swordsman for a while. This is not in line with the nature of a traitor. You must have been building up resentment. You cannot dare to stop the things that often happen in the Wonpyeongilgeomjang. Furthermore… … The conflict that Confucius is worried about may not occur. Since there is no one among our dark swordsmen who is not extraordinary… … .


That was when.


Here and there around the broken round table, eerie waves rose. They were the great lords preparing to launch themselves.


Immediately after the silent agreement was made, the energy of the whole body was circulated in an instant. It was the state of unity of the spirit and energy.


He was on the verge of breaking free from his studies by achieving the Samhwachwijeong.


No questions asked.


The situation has already been brought to a head. Xiahou Weijin’s lifeline is still hanging on. However, it was clearly a hostile move.




The Emperor of the enemy in a state of response does not talk to the enemy. It is a behavioral pattern that has become entrenched as an old tradition.


This was to avoid being deceived by the words of powerful officials.


That was the reason why Aksurim was worried about Jeongyeonshin, but did not speak to the intruder.


‘It wasn’t a self-defense weapon that could be applied by the recommended law.’


The new blood demon Jin Myeong-jo thought.


His innate sense of yin energy was not inferior to that of a famous person. He immediately recognized the internal energy clothing worn by his opponent.


It was very solidly constructed, like a suit of armor made of pure qin. It would be difficult to attack with the blunt point of the recommended method. You have no choice but to use the island blood method.


‘I wish that guy wasn’t here… … !’


Jin Myeong-jo’s ruby-like eyes flashed. He was looking at the newly appointed Ma Gwang-ik-ju, who had no enemies.


The prayers that filled his entire body were extremely divine. He had created a magical martial art in his White Age, but now it seemed like he was using only magical power.


Even though we were apart, I felt like my life was being threatened. Goosebumps appeared on my smooth skin.


I don’t know if I can properly unfold the story.


‘The Sword Master is a monster from Shaanxi? Does that matter? Damn it.’


There is a monster of the Yellow Emperor here.


You have to face the person you want to avoid the most at every meeting.


Rather than the unknown intruder who did not kill Cheonrimdaeju in one go, the Magwangikju that was pressuring him with its very existence was a greater threat.


Psychologically, it was the same. Whenever I thought of the two blue subordinates who had been given to me as a gift, my heart ached. I was so sorry that I almost went crazy.


Orchids, Nilecheon, my faithful servants.


‘But a joint attack? A joint attack with Magwangikju?’


Jin Myeong-jo glared involuntarily.




Immediately after that, he flinched and lowered his eyelashes. The junior had mastered the magical power.


If I looked bad, the meeting would be difficult. I thought I would get into trouble just by sitting next to him. Damn it.


‘ah…….’


His bright red eyes were received differently by Jeong Yeon-shin.


It was a character with two sides: decisive and noble.


As expected of a taciturn senior, he said with a nod. I will take charge of the front, and you will take charge of the rear.


‘You are as dependable as your senior.’


The shame caused by my maternal grandfather, the guilt caused by my seniors.


Even so, he couldn’t strike his grandfather. It was the time when Jeongyeonshin was swallowing her pain.


A voice full of anger rang out.


“Are you guys trying to rebel against the rule of the king right now?”


in the end.


The man in the pink robe raised his head. After Xiahou Weijin was subdued by a sudden surprise attack, where the vein on the back of his neck was grabbed, he eventually lost consciousness.


A face with thick lines was revealed even though there was almost no flesh on it.


Amazingly young.


Even though he was not of noble birth, he seemed to be full of energy. The expression on his face was so ferocious that it looked fierce.


There was no other monarch among the lions running through the wilderness.


“I’m going to get my water now… … .”


Jinmyeongjo, the blood-sucking jewel with five claws, slowly trailed off.


It was a serious black tone that was thrown away. I wanted to propose a joint attack. If you have the experience, that is what you should do.




But I couldn’t finish speaking.


“These pictures?”


Jin Myeong-jo frowned. It was because Aksurim, Cheon So-so, and Un So-yu’s bodies had stopped. They were all frozen solid.


It was as if I had witnessed something that should not have been seen. Even the powerfully blooming waves had subsided.


They are all major shareholders with many years of experience.


Iphwangsinchang lived as a Banrohwandong, and Seonmokryeongju and Yulryeongdaeju lived as famous people for a long time.


He was different from Jin Myeong-jo, who had entered the profession relatively recently and had sat down on the throne in a hurry.


He glanced at Magwangikju.


‘What the heck is that… … .’


The new junior even looked the other way. It seemed like he was completely ignoring me.


at that time.


“no.”


The lips of the Iphwangsinchang Aksurim trembled slightly. The hand holding the black spear was the same.


The momentum that had been rising like wildfire due to the singing technique of Akga disappeared without a trace.


“no…….”


He seemed most surprised in this place. He looked dazed. His lips were slightly parted, and his eyes, which were the characteristic glare of a master, shook slightly.


The pitch-black eyes kept looking back and forth between Jeongyeonshin and the intruder.


“What is this… … .”


It was shocking, in a bad way. Anyone could see it.


Swish.


The corners of Ma Yeon-jeok’s mouth went up as he got up from his seat.


“It’s been a long time since I used to call my grandson a husband. But I still had eyes for you. The years have turned back in the hands of my grandson, who I would never dare to look down on with a song.”


“Really, really… … crazy… … !”


Aksurim’s reaction was fierce. He had been working hard as a subordinate of the new sword master, Mayeonjeok, for a long time.


The eyelashes that were tightly curled up fluttered.


Even though her short hair, which was usually swept back behind her neck, passed her ears, she didn’t raise her hand. Her eyes searched urgently for her junior.


“Are you kidding me? The Lord of the Senate is recovering well, so you’re joking? You’re wearing a mask of human skin. I want you to tell me now because the joke is horrible. I never thought I’d see that face again in my lifetime… .”


“My maternal grandfather has returned to his old age.”


Jeong Yeon-shin spoke, trying to hide her embarrassment.


“Really you? You made that happen?”


“……yes.”


“You are now my enemy… … .”


The bewildered Aksurim muttered weakly.


The aftermath was the responsibility of Grand Master Im Jin-myeong.


In a room where the shock had not yet subsided, everyone decided to continue the meeting while sitting cross-legged on the floor.


Mayeonjeok sat at the top. The other grandees sat on the left, right, and below him. Aksurim sat the furthest away, dragging Jeongyeonshin along.


The faces of Cheon So-so, Un So-yu, and Jin Myeong-jo were dumbfounded. Only the degree of their reactions was different. They had not yet fully accepted the drastic change that could be called Mayeonjeok.


It was a very short time. Xiahou Weijin, who woke up late, remained silent with clear eyes.


Her tightly shut lips were different from usual. There was no sign of her angry temperament, and she placed both hands on her knees as if she had deep cultivation like a clear mirror.


The gang didn’t care.


“I was talking about the mission. Yeonshin, where do you want to go?”


Jeongyeonshin slightly turned her gaze. She was very worried. Her grandfather, who had barged into her workplace, was furious at her grandson’s actions and was holding his hand up. How could she show her face in the future?


He just opened his mouth with difficulty, staring at Xiahou Weijin.


“My skills are still lacking, and I find it difficult to handle a mission that will affect Suncheon-ik’s safety. That’s why I suggested going to Seomseo. I thought it would be better to go to Seomseo, where Jongnam and Hwasan are with Paegeomjong and Yeo-ryeong. I repeat that it was a misunderstanding, Senior Ha-hoo.”


“Seonseo? Yes. Ma Gwang-ik-ju is going to Seonseo.”


Ma Yeon-jeok said. It was a story close to a declaration.


“… … .”


The Grand General, who was laughing alone, opened the next document.


“and…….”


The meeting progressed surprisingly quickly. It was an unprecedented speed. The agenda items of the Wonpyeongil Prosecutor’s Office began to move forward in a flash.
