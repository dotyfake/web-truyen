## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Seo Dae-ryong nhận giải quán quân trong một buổi lễ long trọng, được đích thân thủ lĩnh võ lâm Seo Dae-ryong (Seo Dae-ryong) trao tặng huy chương vàng và tiền thưởng. Thủ lĩnh nhắn nhủ qua thần giao cách cảm, cảnh cáo Dae-ryong không được dùng tà thuật hãm hại người của Chính phái (Jeongpa), nếu không sẽ phải trả giá bằng mạng sống. Dù biết mình chỉ là con tốt thí, Dae-ryong vẫn rất biết ơn.

Jin Ha-ryeong về nhì, nhận cúp và tiền thưởng. Cô cảm thấy thế giới võ lâm rộng lớn hơn mình tưởng và hứa sẽ cố gắng hơn nữa. Nhìn thấy Kiếm Vũ Cực (Geommu-geuk) đứng từ xa cổ vũ, Ha-ryeong xúc động suýt khóc. Jo Shin muốn tặng quà chúc mừng nhưng không kịp vì cô đã thua cuộc, anh ta tức giận quay về.

Trong phòng Jo Shin, Thiết Khôn (Cheolgon) của Thiên Mệnh Hội (Cheonmyeonghoe) đang đợi. Hắn đến để nhắc nhở Jo Shin về lời hứa hôn sự với Jin Ha-ryeong. Một năm trước, nhờ Thiên Mệnh Hội giúp đỡ, Jo Shin đã trở thành người kế vị. Tổ chức này yêu cầu hắn phải cưới cháu gái của thủ lĩnh võ lâm. Jo Shin đã đồng ý và hối lộ để cuộc hôn nhân diễn ra thuận lợi. Tuy nhiên, sự xuất hiện của Seo Dae-ryong đã làm mọi chuyện trở nên khó khăn.

Jo Shin khẳng định Dae-ryong chỉ là thuộc hạ, nhưng Thiết Khôn không tin. Ánh mắt của Thiết Khôn khiến Jo Shin cảm thấy sợ hãi, như thể chỉ cần sơ hở là sẽ bị giết chết. Thiết Khôn ví Jo Shin như một cái cây non yếu ớt, hy vọng hắn sẽ trở thành cây đại thụ. Jo Shin hiểu rằng Thiên Mệnh Hội không quan tâm đến điều đó, chỉ cần hắn hoàn thành nhiệm vụ. Thiết Khôn rời đi, để lại Jo Shin với nỗi lo lắng và tức giận.

Trong khi đó, Seo Dae-ryong vui mừng với số tiền thưởng lớn, chia cho tôi một nửa. Cậu muốn dùng tiền để khao tôi và vị tướng quân, cũng như mua quà cho người phụ nữ bí ẩn đã cổ vũ cậu. Tôi biết cô ta là người của Thiên Mệnh Hội, nhưng không nói cho Dae-ryong biết.

Tôi không tham gia yến tiệc mừng công mà đứng bên ngoài quan sát. Jin Ha-ryeong tìm đến và rủ tôi đi dạo. Cô vẫn còn buồn vì thất bại, nhưng tôi đã an ủi cô. Ha-ryeong thừa nhận đã suýt khóc khi thấy tôi. Cô muốn trở nên mạnh mẽ hơn và tôi khuyên cô nên gạt bỏ gánh nặng dòng tộc. Ha-ryeong cảm thấy khá hơn và trêu chọc hỏi tôi có bạn gái ở nhà không. Tôi trả lời có, và còn xinh hơn cô. Ha-ryeong bật cười, cho rằng tôi đang đùa.

Tôi và Ha-ryeong quay lại yến tiệc, thấy Seo Dae-ryong được mọi người vây quanh. Ai nấy đều muốn kết bạn với cậu, vì từ nay Dae-ryong sẽ gia nhập tổ chức tinh nhuệ của Võ Lâm Minh (Murim Alliance) và thăng tiến. Ha-ryeong nói rằng cô đã trò chuyện với tôi rất nhiều, nhưng chưa từng nói chuyện với Seo Dae-ryong. Tôi khuyến khích cô đến bắt chuyện với Dae-ryong.

Lúc này, người phụ nữ bí ẩn đã cổ vũ Seo Dae-ryong xuất hiện tại yến tiệc, thu hút sự chú ý của mọi người. Seo Dae-ryong ngạc nhiên khi thấy cô ta. Làm thế nào cô ta có thể vào được đây khi không được mời? Người phụ nữ từ từ tiến về phía Seo Dae-ryong.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-168/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-170/)Episode 169: There is a woman prettier than you.




It is an award ceremony as splendid as the music festival.


The winner was awarded a gold medal and prize money. What was even more glorious was that the award was given directly by the leader of the martial arts world.


The warlords called Seo Dae-ryong. Seo Dae-ryong had never heard his name called so many times in his entire life. He probably would never again.


The leader of the martial arts world said while handing over the gold medal to Seo Dae-ryong.


“You have great skills. I hope you will dedicate yourself to the peace of the martial arts world in the future.”


“thank you.”


But what the leader really wanted to say was sent through a telegram.


-If you use that magic to harm a member of the Jeongpa clan, you will surely die by my hand.


Seo Dae-ryong didn’t dare to object and just quietly took the gold medal and the prize money and came down. Even though he knew that he was a mine, he was grateful that he was given the prize.


Jin Ha-ryeong, who came in second, was also awarded a trophy and prize money.




“Good job.”


“sorry.”


“Do you feel it now? How vast this world is?”


“Yes, I thought I would become a snake, if not a dragon, but I realized that I was a frog in a well. I will work even harder in the future, Grandpa.”


That was enough. The Murim Lord patted her shoulder with a satisfied smile.


Jin Ha-ryeong, who was coming down from the stage after receiving the award, glanced at Geommu-geuk standing in the distance.


The sword dance waved at her. It conveyed the feeling of, “Well done, my friend.”


When Jin Ha-ryeong saw that sight, tears suddenly welled up in his eyes. He had not thought much about it until then, but when he saw the sword dance, he was overcome with a sense of needless sadness.


She walked briskly because she couldn’t shed tears in front of the heroes. They said Jin Ha-ryeong cried at the awards ceremony, that he cried because he was angry. It was really horrible to hear such rumors.


Someone next to her said something to her, but she didn’t even look up and quickly walked away.




The person who spoke to her was none other than Jo Shin. He had a defeated look on his face and couldn’t follow her. In his arms was a gift to commemorate her victory.


I couldn’t give it to her because I had engraved the words “Congratulations on winning” on the knife. I really couldn’t imagine that she would lose. I should have given it to her nicely because she won.


“f\*ck! f\*ck!”


His gaze turned to Seo Dae-ryong. Seo Dae-ryong was still too busy receiving congratulations.


‘That country bumpkin even won? Does that make sense?’


The master was winning, and the servant was seducing the woman he was going to marry. They were really two men who would kill each other. This could not possibly end well.


So Jo-sin returned to his residence in a very angry state.


Jo-shin was startled as he entered the room. A man was waiting for him in the room.


He was Cheolgon (鐵坤), the one who delivered the orders of Cheonmyeonghoeju.


At first, Cho-shin thought that this man named Cheol-gon was a Cheonmyeonghoeju disguised as an errand boy. The prayers that Cheol-gon was spewing out were not ordinary.




‘This guy is just a subordinate? Then how great is Cheonmyeonghoeju?’


I haven’t met Cheonmyeonghoeju in person yet, but I had promised to meet him once I finished this work safely.


Anyway, Jo-shin was displeased that someone had come to his room without permission, but he couldn’t express his dissatisfaction.


“Are you here?”


“Wasn’t it Prince Zhao who called me?”


“I called you?”


“Didn’t you say you were confident about marrying Jin Ha-ryeong?”


“Of course.”


Just a year ago, Jo Shin was losing in the struggle for Jinryongjang’s succession.


It was at that time that the Cheonmyeonghoe appeared before him. He could not refuse the offer to make him his successor if he joined hands with them.


It was good that he became the successor with the help of Cheonmyeonghoe.


When he was confirmed as the successor, they made one request. That was to marry the granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world. It was not an impossible request. As for Jinryongjang, he was from a family that had no shortage of connections to the leader of the martial arts world.


Jo Shin persuaded his father and even donated a huge amount of money to the Murim Alliance to make this marriage happen.


The reason he chose the time of the Little Dragon Chronicles was because he could see her often. He was confident that he could easily win Jin Ha-ryeong’s heart, since he was known to be handsome wherever he went, and he was from his own family. That was until he found out about that damned attendant.


“I heard from rumors that there was a line behind the attendant.”


“Where did you hear such a rumor? He is my subordinate.”


As Jo-shin spoke confidently, Cheol-gon stared intently. When their eyes met, he felt intimidated just like when they first met. If this intimidating murderous intent was intentional, Jo-shin would never have lost his spirit.


But Jo-shin felt it. This murderous intent was coming from that man’s innate nature. The kind of primal murderous intent that only someone who sees no meaning in killing people can exude. A murderous intent that gives him the feeling of fear that if he were to carelessly open his mouth, he would be torn to pieces and thrown into a dirty cesspool.


“He’s your subordinate?”


“I have recruited Jin Ha-ryeong for the marriage. I will use him to make the marriage a success.”




It wasn’t a lie. I promised to give the bastard a hundred thousand nyang and made it on the other hand. Of course, it wasn’t planned that way from the beginning.


Cheol-gon stared at Jo-shin again.


If this gaze were that of some intelligent person trying to understand himself, it would have been okay.


But the gaze at the moment was closer to indifference. The blunt gaze of a murderer who didn’t care about the truth and only cared about the results.


As you can see from the iron club in front of you, these people are not ordinary. There was an incident in a certain area, and who was behind it? They are not just some random rumors.


These people were special. If you kept your promise, the other party would definitely give you a reward. They were evil people who only acted for their own benefit, but because of that, they were the kind of people who could definitely get what they wanted. That’s why they joined hands with these people.


Cheol-gon got up from his seat and walked to the window.


“Come here and look at it.”


Josin walked carefully and stood next to him.


“That broken sapling over there is the one I stepped on and broke. Whoever planted them must have planted them too close together. If they were that way, neither of the two trees would grow into a large tree.”


Cheol-gon slowly looked at Jo-shin.


“We hope you grow into a big tree.”


Jo Shin knows that these words are not sincere.


Cheol-gon didn’t care at all. Whether he became a giant tree or not. If Cheonmyeonghoeju wanted to kill him, he would kill him, and if he wanted to spare him, he would spare him. To him, he wasn’t even a broken sapling.


If it were up to him, he would have gone and yelled at his own son to do the same thing. He hated being meddled and pressured like this by someone. Being polite to the villains would only make them look down on him more.

But Jo Shin didn’t dare to do that.


“I won’t let you down.”


“I will prepare the congratulatory money and wait.”


Cheol-gon quietly left the room.


As soon as he disappeared, Jo Shin let out a sigh he had been holding. It was a sigh that was a mixture of tension, fear, annoyance, and anger.


The marriage issue, the servants, the Cheonmyeonghoe, all of these issues were not as easy as they had hoped. It felt like his life, which had been comfortable up until now, was entering a new phase of difficulty. Of course, Jo-shin would not give up because of that.


‘I’ll give it back to you properly someday.’


He hadn’t said those words yet. That was after he had raised his family to be the strongest in the martial arts world.


\* \* \*


“The prize money is a whopping ten thousand nyang!”


Seo Dae-ryong was so happy with the sudden money that he didn’t know what to do.


Seo Dae-ryong gave me five thousand nyang.


“Okay, since we won together, let’s split it in half.”


“Are you going to regret it later?”


“I’ll be happy with just five thousand nyang. I can treat the general and this gentleman with this. And… … .”


“also?”


“I also bought something delicious for the woman who cheered me on.”


“Did you decide to meet up?”


“No, I don’t even know the name yet.”


We’ll find out soon enough. She’ll definitely approach Seodaeryong in some way. How will she do it?




“She’s someone who’s been rooting for me since long before I won. That makes her special.”


Seo Dae-ryong was already head over heels in love with that woman.


“Oh, are you going to the banquet together?”


The Murim Alliance held a congratulatory banquet, inviting all the winners and finalists.


“I have to go.”


“I’m going to buy some clothes to wear to the banquet. Would you like to come with me? I’ll buy you a set of clothes.”


“I’m fine. You go buy some nice clothes.”


“Of course, I will definitely take this opportunity to buy an expensive suit!”


As the excited Seo Dae-ryong left his seat, I spoke to the air.


“I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you in advance. The situation was so urgent at the time.”


It was what I said to the unmanned man who was hiding around me. When I was going to Chung-ui with Seo Dae-ryong, I ran at a high speed, so he couldn’t catch up with me.


After returning to the Murim Alliance, I felt that he was hiding around me again, but I didn’t have the time to talk to him separately because I was training with Seo Dae-ryong. From his perspective, he must have felt bad.


But as usual, the stealthy drone showed no reaction. He was truly a man who followed orders.


I’m sorry, I’m sorry. I didn’t tell him that the woman who approached Seo Dae-ryong was from Cheonmyeonghoe. I thought there was no need to tell him in advance.


\* \* \*


I didn’t enter the banquet hall.


Today’s main character had to be Seo Dae-ryong. I stood outside the banquet hall, watching the inside as if I were a servant.


But somehow Jin Ha-ryeong knew and came out to where I was.


“Why aren’t you coming in?”


“I just felt frustrated.”




“Shall we take a walk?”


“It’s good.”


I took a walk around the yard with her.


“I actually came to see you before the finals. Do you know what I was going to say when I came to see you? I could lose if you asked me to? I was going to tease you like this.”


She still seemed embarrassed and concerned about losing in the duel. She was more talkative and quick-witted than usual.


“I didn’t know I would lose like this. Isn’t it really funny? Thinking about it makes me so embarrassed that I can’t even sleep. By the way, where have you been? By the way, which organization will you be joining this time? You… … .”


I cut her off from her outburst.


“Friend, stop.”


Only then did Jin Ha-ryeong exhale deeply. After calming down for a moment, she revealed her true feelings.


“I saw you yesterday and almost cried.”


“It’s okay to lose once in a while.”


In fact, it’s okay to lose many times. As long as you have the will to keep going. When you get older, it’s really just a failure, but why did it feel like the sky was falling at that time?


Maybe that’s why I miss my youth more. Those days when my whole body and mind would flutter and react to even the smallest things.


“I don’t want to feel that weak anymore.”


“Put aside the burden of being the granddaughter of the leader. The leader is the leader, and you are who you are. You can’t enjoy it because of that burden. You came in second place in this big competition.”


Jin Ha-ryeong smiled faintly.


“What? Are you feeling better already?”


“Yeah. It made me feel better to see you trying to comfort me.”


“Easy. Just make them feel good.”


“Please do this often in the future.”




She was absolutely certain that Seodaeryong would join the Murim Alliance. Naturally, she assumed that I would live with him.


“You can go back home.”


She was startled by those words.


“You’re going back? Why?”


She looked at me for a moment and then asked cautiously.


“Do you have a girl back home? A girl you like?”


“Yes.”


For a moment, she flinched. She seemed half in doubt, perhaps because I answered too easily.


“There is a girl prettier than you.”


“Better than me? Then the credibility of your words will definitely drop.”


“Aren’t you the best in Hubei? Over there, you’re the best in the world.”


She laughed, relaxing. I guess she thought I was making fun of her.


“Please show me next time, that best beauty in the world!”


“If we get a chance.”


Will the day ever come when Ian and Jin Ha-ryeong meet? Even I had no idea.


By the way, what is Ian doing? Is he immersed in martial arts training at this very moment? Has he really overcome his limits and advanced to the next level? Ah! I miss you, Ian!


After taking a walk around the garden, I returned to the banquet hall with Jin Ha-ryeong.


When I arrived at the banquet hall and looked inside through the window, I saw Seo Dae-ryong surrounded by the later indexes.


Although I don’t know what they really think, everyone was smiling and trying to become friends with Seo Dae-ryong. This is because from now on, Seo Dae-ryong will enter the core elite organization of the Murim Alliance and rise through the ranks.


“Our master looks happy.”




No one ignored him, despite his short stature and gloomy appearance. His figure was brighter than usual, as if clothes made his wings.


Okay, enjoy today to the fullest.


Jin Ha-ryeong, who was looking at Seo Dae-ryong, spoke to me.


“I have had so many conversations with you, but I have never had a proper conversation with you, the young master who defeated me.”


“Go and talk to him.”


“No. I want to stay here. If I go in, all I’ll get is comfort. Your comfort alone is enough for today!”


At that time, a new person entered the banquet hall.


I was surprised when I saw the person. Surprisingly, it was the woman who had been cheering for Seo Dae-ryong.


Seo Dae-ryong was also surprised when he saw her. It was a banquet attended only by invited guests, but she showed up.


How on earth did she get in uninvited?


The woman slowly walked towards Seo Dae-ryong, receiving everyone’s attention.
