# Absolute Regression Chapter 160 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Jin Pae-cheon, thủ lĩnh võ lâm, xuất hiện tại hôn lễ của con trai Jin Yong Jang Ju và hỏi thân phận của nhân vật chính. Jin Ha-ryeong bất ngờ tuyên bố cậu là người mình đang hẹn hò, gây náo loạn. Jin Pae-cheon không tin, cho rằng đây chỉ là trò đùa của cháu gái.

Bất chấp sự phản đối của ông nội, Jin Ha-ryeong khẳng định tình cảm của mình và mong muốn kết hôn với cậu. Jin Pae-cheon chấp thuận, thậm chí còn ra lệnh chuẩn bị hôn lễ ngay lập tức. Jin Ha-ryeong hoảng hốt, vì chưa hề tính đến chuyện này, còn chưa ra mắt gia đình cậu. Jin Pae-cheon mời cậu đến uống rượu với tư cách "con rể tương lai" và cảnh cáo cậu bằng ánh mắt lạnh lùng, thâm hiểm.

Trước tình thế đó, Jin Ha-ryeong đành phải nhận thua, thú nhận rằng mọi chuyện chỉ là kế hoạch để bảo vệ cậu khỏi những kẻ ghen ghét. Cô giải thích với mọi người rằng có kẻ muốn hãm hại cậu vì cô ở bên cạnh cậu. Jo Shin vỗ tay mỉa mai, còn Jin Ha-ryeong cảnh cáo mọi người không được làm hại cậu.

Sau khi rời khỏi yến tiệc, Jin Ha-ryeong xin lỗi vì đã không báo trước cho cậu. Cô đưa tiền cho cậu và khuyên cậu nên rời đi thật xa, đến một nơi không ai biết cậu, tránh xa nguy hiểm trước khi "Tiểu Long Chiến (Little Dragon War)" kết thúc. Cô tin rằng mình đã bảo vệ cậu theo cách tốt nhất có thể.

Nhân vật chính nhìn theo bóng lưng Jin Ha-ryeong và thầm nghĩ, muốn thống nhất võ lâm chỉ có cách giết hết bọn người này. Cậu quyết định nói ra sự thật với Jin Pae-cheon.

Khi chỉ còn hai người, cậu tiết lộ mình là thành viên của Thiên Ma Thần Giáo (Cheonmasin Church), nhị công tử của giáo chủ. Jin Pae-cheon lập tức tấn công cậu bằng một chưởng lực kinh hoàng. Cậu gắng gượng chống đỡ, chứng minh giá trị của mình.

Cậu nói tiếp, rằng chỉ có cậu mới có thể cứu được Jin Ha-ryeong. Sát khí của Jin Pae-cheon biến thành nỗi sợ hãi. Cậu cảm nhận được áp lực kinh khủng từ người thủ lĩnh võ lâm đương thời.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-159/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-161/)Episode 160: Son-in-law, come here and have a drink with me.




As the leader’s gaze turned towards us, the noisy room began to quiet down.


His gaze passed over his granddaughter and turned to me, who was standing next to him. I avoided eye contact with him and slightly lowered my head.


I could tell without looking that his eyes were on me. It was a tense moment, and I didn’t try to hide my nervousness. It was even stranger that an ordinary servant wouldn’t be nervous in a situation like this.


Even if I got caught, I tried my best not to reveal myself.


The leader of the martial arts world, Jin Pae-cheon, asked me.


“Who is Sohyeop?”


At that very moment, Jin Ha-ryeong spoke loudly.


“This is the person I’m dating.”


This was her plan to save me.


I also went head-on, but her choice was also head-on. I had expected it to some extent, but seeing it in person made me appreciate her courage and consideration. As the granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world, how could it be easy to say those words in front of so many people?




Her words caused a commotion around them. Among them were Jo Shin and his father, Jin Yong Jang Ju.


Jinryongjangju frowned. He was in the middle of his son’s wedding, but his daughter-in-law had brought home another man.


On the other hand, Jo Shin, who was standing next to us, smiled at us. But he must have felt very insulted.


When Jinpaecheon raised his hand, the surroundings suddenly became quiet.


“I didn’t ask you.”


After speaking to Jin Ha-ryeong, Jin Pae-cheon asked me again.


“Who is Sohyeop?”


“It’s called black smoke.”


“Which temple are you from?”


“I am the attendant who brought Lord Xu Long of the Xu Dao Sect of Gansu.”




At the word “attendant,” the surroundings became noisy again. It was a louder noise than before.


Although Jin Pae-cheon was not one to show his emotions in front of the warlords, he could not hide his embarrassment at this moment.


Jinpaecheon looked at Jinhaeryeong. He said with his expression. Are you really going to do this? Jinhaeryeong’s expression was firm, yes.


Jinpaecheon’s gaze turned to me again. Aside from her bombshell declaration, how much did the leader know about me?


“Sword and so-hyeop.”


Even though I told him I was a servant, he called me a sycophant.


“Young-yi has been a mischievous child. She was particularly good at surprising people. One time, she almost fell into a state of magic possession by using her swordsmanship skills in reverse. Today, she brought you here to surprise me.”


Jinpaecheon spoke as if today’s events were also part of her prank.


“Everyone was surprised enough, so I think you’ve done your part. You must have had a hard time being dragged here by the guy. I’ll treat you separately next time, so you can leave now.”


The leader summarized the situation like this. Some may think that Jin Ha-ryeong was joking, while others may think that the leader was trying to cover up her rebellion in this way.




At least one thing was clear: no one thought I was the real person she was seeing.


Of course, Jin Ha-ryeong did not back down easily.


“You must have been very surprised at that time. If my grandfather hadn’t been here, I wouldn’t have been alive until now. That’s why I’m not going to joke around anymore. This person is the one I really like.”


Everyone’s eyes were focused on me again. Some people clicked their tongues and sighed at my appearance.


The expressions were all like this. From ‘Yes, it’s the child in my arms’ to ‘The leader is no exception.’ They just couldn’t bring themselves to say anything in front of the leader.


“Did you say you like that guy?”


“yes.”


Her answer to her grandfather’s question was one of unhesitating.


There was tension between the two. It was even more intense than on stage. Everyone except Jo Shin and Jin Yong Jang Ju watched this situation with excitement.


“Then I guess I can marry that man.”


Jin Ha-ryeong flinched when marriage was mentioned.


“But marriage is a matter of human relationships, so we should date a little longer.”


“Why are you hesitating when you’ve already declared it in front of so many people? Okay. Since you’re the one who wants it, I’ll let you marry me.”


“grandfather!”


“I’ll marry you right here and now. Isn’t that what you want? I don’t want to have a political marriage. I want to marry someone I like. Fine, I’ll do as you wish!”


Jinpaecheon did not stop here and went one step further.


“Prepare for marriage right away.”


As soon as the leader’s order was given, his subordinates really came and started preparing for the wedding.


As the situation unfolded like this, Jin Ha-ryeong’s expression was clearly flustered.


I knew that my grandfather had an unusual personality, but I didn’t know that he would push for marriage like this.




“I haven’t even said hello to that guy’s family yet.”


“The people of the martial arts world are not bound by formalities, so they will understand. Go back later and greet them politely.”


Jin Ha-ryeong looked at me with a bewildered face. This situation was truly something even I had not expected.


“My future son-in-law, come here and have a drink with me.”


A prospective son-in-law? Seriously, it was the first time I had heard that before my return. And you’re hearing that from the leader of the martial arts world? Father, I’m getting a drink from the leader of the martial arts world while hearing the name of my son-in-law!


I received the drink that the leader gave me. It was the first drink I received from him.


“thank you.”


“Please take good care of our granddaughter from now on.”


I could tell from the deep, cold eyes he was looking at me with. He had already figured out my true nature. He wanted to deal with me after he had resolved the granddaughter issue in front of the warlords.


He smiled faintly at me. It wasn’t a smile of pleasure, but a warning that I would see you later.


In the meantime, wedding preparations were made in no time. Since the martial artists of the Murim Alliance often held weddings, wedding preparations were not that difficult.


In the end, Jin Ha-ryeong raised the white flag.


“Stop it! I lost. We’re not meant to be married.”


Only then did Jinpaecheon smile.


Where did you get the call from to this old man?

I admit defeat, Grandpa. But I have to explain this.


After this exchange of expressions, Jin Ha-ryeong explained to everyone what happened today.


“Elders, seniors, I apologize for ruining this precious occasion. There is a reason why I caused such a commotion today. Someone is trying to kill that person out of jealousy just because I was with them. That is why I planned this to protect that person.”


Then someone in attendance clapped and shouted.


“You are wonderful.”


He was the one who was careful.


“You went to such lengths for that shabby, ugly servant! You are truly amazing!”


When he clapped, others clapped along.


I felt that Jo-shin was really poisonous. It was actually good. It’s easy to make mistakes when emotions are running high. Let’s go crazy and run wild.


Jin Ha-ryeong spoke loudly to everyone.


“From now on, if anyone touches this person, I will definitely take revenge on him in my name. Bullying the weak is something my grandfather taught me to avoid all my life, so please keep that in mind.”


It was a very smart choice to mention the leader.


After Jin Ha-ryeong finished speaking, he grabbed my sleeve.


“Okay, I’ll go back now. Grandpa, I’m sorry about what happened today. I’ll come back and apologize.”


She and I greeted the leader politely and followed Jin Ha-ryeong out of there.


We left the banquet hall and walked silently through the Murim Alliance civil war.


Then she stopped walking.


“I’m sorry I didn’t tell you in advance.”


“it’s okay.”


“You told me then, right? That my selfishness was hurting the other person.”




“I didn’t say that directly.”


“That’s what it means. Yes, I handled this situation this way, too. But no matter how much I thought about it, this was the only way to protect you.”


Regardless of whether her methods were right or wrong, she truly wanted to protect me.


“I said this in front of my grandfather, so I won’t dare to do anything to hurt you. If you do this after I’ve done this, I’ll be happy. I’ll have an excuse to never have a political marriage. Look, my grandfather said I was a good person, but I’m not.”


“Then I will gladly die for you, young lady.”


Jin Ha-ryeong looked at me with a slightly angry expression.


“I know it’s a joke, but don’t joke like that. That’s what I’ve heard from my grandfather countless times since I was little. Protecting good people from bad people. That’s the only thing our party exists for. I’m not that great, but I won’t stand by and watch others suffer because of me.”


“That’s great.”


“I didn’t say that to hear compliments.”


“But is that okay? Tomorrow, rumors will spread about what happened today.”


“Bad rumors won’t spread. Rather, the granddaughter of the Murim Alliance leader caused a commotion to save her servant! Good rumors will spread. The Alliance also manages such things. Didn’t you know?”


She stared at me.


“At least until the end of the Little Dragon War, I won’t be able to do anything to you. Take the opportunity to go far away. Don’t go back to your hometown, go somewhere far away.”


She took the money out of her bosom and gave it to me.


“I’m sorry I couldn’t keep my promise to buy you three bowls of noodles and a drink.”


It was more money than the price of noodles and alcohol. It seemed to be money given to those who were running away.


Regret flowed from her eyes toward me. She thought this moment was the last. Even if I didn’t leave right away, she had no intention of coming to me. So that I wouldn’t be in danger again.


“Then I hope you are happy.”


After saying goodbye and turning around to walk away, I watched her back and then looked down at the money in my hand.


Then I looked up at the bright moon.




Father, the unification of martial arts world that you dream of can only be achieved by killing all these people.


I looked up at the night sky like that and turned around and said.


“I have something to tell you.”


Before I knew it, Jin Pae-cheon, the leader of the martial arts world, had silently followed me. She must have heard our conversation.


“Of course you should say it. And you should say it well. Your life depends on every word you say.”


Jinpaecheon, who opened his prayer room, was not the person he had seen at the banquet hall earlier.


His prayer felt like the ocean. I could hear the deep sound of a whale’s cry from afar, and the wind that blew smelled like the ocean. I had the illusion that I was floating alone in an endless ocean.


The next moment.


Chock! Chock! Chock! Chock! Chock! Chock! Chock! Chock! Chock!


Dozens of unmanned personnel fell from all directions like lightning striking vertically. They had their faces covered with white masks and were wearing white uniforms. They were the masters of the Heavenly Dragon Guardians, who would accompany their leader wherever he went, even to hell.


Chae-Ang!


Dozens of people drew their swords at the same time, but it sounded like one person did it. Just by drawing their swords, I could tell how well-trained and skilled they were. The momentum from their swords suffocated me like a spider web.


“I want to be alone with you, my lord.”


“Is there any reason why I should do that?”


“What I am about to tell you is something that only you, the leader, should know.”


The leader did not retreat from his surroundings. Also, the guards would not easily retreat when faced with an unfamiliar master.


“If I had come today to ambush the lord, there would have been another opportunity or method. At least I wouldn’t have tried it in this tense situation.”


Then the leader said to them,


“Everyone, step back.”


Then, in an instant, they flew away and disappeared. They disappeared from sight, but I know that they did not disappear completely. I also know that I cannot make them retreat completely.




They were not the ones who took orders from the leader, but those who protected the leader. No matter what happened, they never left the leader’s side.


They would carry out all orders, but they would not accept the order not to protect me.


So, to kill the leader, you have to kill them all.


I sent a message to Jinpaecheon.


-From now on, I will speak in full voice.


-Tell me your identity first.


I revealed my identity to him.


-I am a member of the Cheonmasin Church… … .


Before the words could even be finished.


Phaaaang!


A single ray of tension shot out from Jinpaecheon’s hand like lightning and struck me.


Kwaaang!


There was a loud explosion around me and dust rose up all around me.


When the dust settled, I stood there, crossing my arms in front of me and drawing my shin ki up to block the tension.


I looked at Jinpaecheon beyond my crossed arms and continued what I had said before.


―… … The second son of the cult leader.


Aaaa …


Kwaaaaang!


This time, a stronger force flew in and hit me.


I stood there, unmoved, with my arms crossed and blocking. Even though my self-defense was at its peak, my arms still felt like they were going to fall off.




―… … It’s a sword dance.


By holding off these two tensions, I have proven my worth.


The eyes of the tiger-like leader were shining. The person who was like Sohyeop when he was asked who he was was completely different from the person who was radiating fierce energy now. And I could feel it. The burning now was his true form.


-Why did the devil’s son approach my granddaughter?


I uncrossed my arms and straightened my lowered body.


-To save my granddaughter.


Jinpaecheon’s prayers became fierce. It felt like my whole body was being torn apart by the overwhelming momentum swirling around me.


This is the prayer of the contemporary martial arts leader who can tear people apart with just his momentum.


The tension that will come flying in next will be incomparably stronger than the tension that came before. If he draws his sword, each move will be a move that determines life or death.


It was just the beginning. The fight to convince him or not.


-Only I can save my granddaughter.


Jinpaecheon’s prayer changed from ferocity to fear. The world became dark as dark clouds gathered, and the sea began to turn upside down.
