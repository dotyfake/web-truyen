## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Sau khi gặp Sima Minh, nhân vật chính (tôi) trở về và thấy Huyết Thiên Độc Ma (Hyeolcheon Doma) đang đợi. Họ cùng nhau uống rượu, và Huyết Thiên Độc Ma báo rằng giáo chủ (cult leader - ý chỉ cha của nhân vật chính) sẽ chấp thuận yêu cầu của cậu về việc rời giáo phái. Dù vui mừng, nhân vật chính vẫn không quên mối nguy hiểm từ Hỏa Vụ Khí (Hwamugi) và quyết tâm mạnh hơn nữa. Huyết Thiên Độc Ma bất ngờ khen cậu là người con có phúc, khơi gợi trong cậu nỗi lo lắng về việc mắc sai lầm khi ở bên cha.

Sau khi Huyết Thiên Độc Ma rời đi, nhân vật chính sử dụng thuật không gian-thời gian để luyện tập Cửu Hoa Ma Công (Guhwamagong). Cậu tin rằng bí mật của thời gian, thông qua Thần Thiên Bí Thuật (Shicheonbisul), sẽ giúp cậu đạt được cảnh giới cao hơn. Cậu bắt đầu luyện tập thức thứ nhất của Cửu Thủ Ma Kiếm (Nine-Handed Demon Sword), Tuyệt Hồn Ma Kích (Jeolhonma Gyeok), một kỹ thuật nguy hiểm có thể gây chết người nếu sai sót. Trong quá trình luyện tập, cậu tạo ra những luồng kiếm khí đen tối, nhưng vẫn chưa kiểm soát được chúng hoàn toàn. Cậu tiếp tục luyện tập với quyết tâm và niềm tin.

Ba ngày sau, Sima Minh đến báo tin chính thức rằng giáo chủ đã đồng ý. Nhân vật chính biết ơn Sima Minh vì sự ủng hộ của ông. Sima Minh thông báo rằng trong thời gian cậu rời đi, cậu sẽ được coi như đang bế quan tu luyện, và Thiên Ma Vệ (Heavenly Horse Guards) sẽ bí mật theo sau bảo vệ. Nhân vật chính muốn có thời gian riêng với cha, nên đề nghị chỉ để Huy (Hwi) theo hộ tống. Sima Minh đồng ý và cho biết điểm đến là Thiểm Tây (Shaanxi), và họ có thể đi bằng xe hoặc đi bộ tùy ý. Họ sẽ khởi hành vào rạng sáng ngày mai.

Sau khi gặp Sima Minh, nhân vật chính đến gặp cha. Cậu thấy cha đang lúng túng thu dọn hành lý. Cậu cảm nhận được sự khác biệt trong thái độ của cha và nhận ra rằng ông cũng đang mong chờ chuyến đi này. Cậu trêu chọc cha bằng cách nhắc ông nhớ mang theo đồ ngủ.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-445/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-447/)446  

When I returned to my residence after meeting Sima Ming, someone was waiting for me in the yard.




The person who was leaning against the sword and drinking alcohol while leaning against it was none other than Hyeolcheon Doma.


On my way back, I had a sudden feeling that he might come. It seems like we’ve gotten close enough that my premonition is coming true.


“Have a drink.”


“Okay.”


I received the drink that Hyeolcheon Doma gave me and drank it down.


“It’s so nice to have a drink with an elder after such a long time.”


“You must have had a lot to drink with that drunkard.”


“I barely drank. I abstained from drinking until I killed the bastards behind the scenes.”


“okay?”


Hyeolcheon Doma made a surprised expression.




“The world of the unknown drunkard?”


Hyeolcheondoma smiled faintly at my joke and drank his alcohol.


After pouring each other drinks and drinking a few glasses in a pleasant mood, Hyeolcheondoma finally said what he wanted to say.


“The cult leader will grant your request.”


“Why do you think so?”


Looking down at his glass, Hyeolcheondoma answered.


“If I were the leader, I would have allowed it.”


Why would that be? Only Hyeolcheon Doma had feelings for his father. This time, it was Hyeolcheon Doma who first realized that his father had moved for the unification of the martial arts world.


“I just met with the military officer. He said that, as you said, my father would approve.”


Even though his premonition was right, Hyeolcheon Doma did not rejoice or show off. He seemed to be both happy and worried about this excommunication.




“Are you happy about going out with the leader?”


“Yes, that’s fine.”


It felt good to just think about leaving the church with my father. But I must not forget.


Even if we are with our father, we must not forget that our enemy is firearms.


After establishing the Cheonmasingyo, the Murim Alliance, and the Sadomaeng, Hwamugi continued his journey towards the pinnacle of martial arts through endless training.


No matter what tyranny the Twelve Zodiac Kings who followed him committed, he never officially appeared in the martial arts world.


In other words, it means that at least he was not a person who had worldly desires.


Why on earth did he kill the three leaders of the martial arts world? What kind of life did he live before, and what kind of life did he live after?


I regret not finding out about it while I was busy searching for Dafa materials.


At the time, I was afraid that I would get close to him and ruin things. Instead, I tried to distance myself from him. I thought that if I just went back, everything would be fixed.




Anyway, one thing is certain: he is by no means an ordinary person.


That’s why it may not appear until all the twelve kings are dead, or it may appear suddenly.


Maybe it was because of this weapon that my way of life became what it is now.


I don’t care about him and I live my life as best I can.


Even if I wanted to respond to him, I couldn’t.


So, Firearm, you fit into my life!


Just like I did before my regression, it won’t be easy for you to respond to me. I’m probably someone who is beyond common sense and expectations.


While I was lost in thought for a moment, Hyeolcheon Doma suddenly blurted out something unexpected.


“A cult leader who has a son like you is blessed with a son.”


It was the first time he had said that since we had met. Of course, he was probably a heavenly horse on the list of blessed fathers, so I was going to joke around and ask seriously. It was the first time I had heard the Blood Heavenly Horse say something like that.


“Do you really think so?”


“How many people in the entire church would be so happy to go out with the leader?”


“It’s the same throughout the martial arts world.”


“But don’t go out and mess with the leader too much.”


“Are you worried about me?”


Bloodthirsty Demon shook his head, then nodded again, then shook his head again.


“I wonder who would worry about whom when they are better than me at everything.”


The blood clot looked at me.


“If you look at it this way, isn’t it a fresh green child?”


How can you not understand his mind? The reason why young people are anxious when seen by older people is probably because of this experience. Because we always made ridiculous mistakes back then.




That’s why I’m worried. I’m worried that if I go out with my father, I’ll make a mistake. I’m worried that the reason I haven’t made a mistake until now is because I’ve been saving up for this moment.


“I’m not a child.”


“In my eyes, she is a child.”


“But I wish I could go back to my age.”


I often get the feeling that he misses his youth, although he always denies it.


“Even if I cough, it won’t go away.”


“why?”


“I don’t want to live this life again.”


His longing for youth was genuine, but these words also sounded sincere.


“You can live differently.”


“Do people live differently even though they are the same?”


“You will survive. You have lived this life well.”


Bloodthirsty Demon looked at me silently, then emptied his last glass and stood up. He pulled out the Heavenly Sword stuck in the ground and said goodbye.


“Have a nice trip.”


“Yes, sir.”

I turned around and spoke to him as he walked away.


“This time, I will go out with my father and see many things and come back. So, please see as many sights as you want and live.”


Then, the Bloodthirsty Demon turned to me and spoke firmly.


“I already live like that.”


From the gaze directed at me, I felt that I was standing in that scenery.


\* \* \*


After the Bloodthirsty Demon returned, I entered the room and immediately used the space-time teleportation technique.


Even I cannot achieve the Twelve Great Stars of the Nine Flower Demonic Arts in five years. This is because it takes an absolute amount of time to train in martial arts.


However, the reason I promised five years is because I believe in the secret of time.


The Shicheonbisul, which used to give me three times more time, has now increased to four times as much as a result of my consistent practice while reducing my sleep. This means that if others practice for one hour, I can practice for four hours.


Moreover, during this trip to the North Sea, my internal energy increased significantly and my training became easier.


You have to somehow increase the time you get from the Shicheon Secret Technique by tenfold. However, as your level increases, the training will become more difficult and your achievements will also become slower. Only effort is the way to survive.


It was performed in one go from the first ritual of the Nine-Handed Demon Sword’s Destruction Ceremony to the sacrificial ritual of Darkness.


Then, by using the mind method, I filled my internal energy and controlled my mind.


Now, I am going to unfold the Guhwamagong Jeo-shik for the first time.


If I go out with my father, there will definitely be an opportunity to learn the essence of the Nine-Handed Demonic Cultivation from him. For that time, I plan to go out after being able to unfold the Jeo-shik.


The Nine-Handed Demon Sword, the Soul-Cutting Demon Strike.


The practice of the Jeo-o style was dangerous from the very beginning. It was a style known to be so dangerous that if one made a single mistake, the person performing the martial arts could suffer a fatal injury or even die. That was why I had to concentrate more than when I was using any other style.


You have to unfold it with the mindset that if you make a mistake, you will die.


I slowly drew my sword while reciting the Jeoshik Mantra.




At that moment,


The surroundings changed. The sky and surroundings became dark and gloomy, as if a typhoon was about to strike.


The silence continues.


It wasn’t just silence. It was absolute silence, drowning out all the noise in the world. Even if you were in the middle of a noisy battlefield, all sounds would disappear.


The moment I swung my sword!


Swish swish swish swish swish swish swish swish!


Ten streaks of black energy poured down vertically from the sky.


Pak pak pak pak pak pak pak pak pak!


Black auras pouring down all around!


The swordsmen dug a thin, deep hole in the floor, so deep that the end could not be seen.


It was an attack that literally struck the enemy’s center like a bolt of lightning.


Since it was the first time I had deployed it, the sword energy didn’t land where I wanted it to. In fact, two of the sword energy lines landed right next to me. They almost hit me.


Of all the vital points on a human body, the most difficult to block is the crown of the head.


The most difficult part of self-defense is protecting the crown. Imagine a lightning-quick black energy striking down there.


Moreover, the sword technique was not an ordinary sword technique. The sword technique imbued with the essence of the Nine-Handed Demon was a powerful attack that could tear apart the opponent’s self-defense energy and vertically cut off their head. Of course, it was also a super technique that could not be used recklessly because it consumed a lot of internal energy.


Lastly, the essence of the Jeolhonma Gyeok is that it is a super-powerful attack that can deal with multiple enemies. It is currently only ten lines, but as the level of the Nine Flower Magical Skills increases, the power of the sword energy that is struck increases and the number of them gradually increases.


Imagine this.


The sight of dozens of swords simultaneously falling from the sky like divine punishment, piercing the heads of dozens of enemies.


How many enemies can Father strike with the Death Strike at the same time?


Twenty people? Fifty people? A hundred people?




I had no idea what a successful Guhwamagong would look like since I had never experienced it before.


The second climactic battle unfolded again.


Swish swish swish swish swish swish swish swish!


Again, black lightning poured down vertically.


Pak pak pak pak pak pak pak pak pak!


The swords were still beyond my control. Overall, they had moved away from me a bit, but one of them had fallen closer than before. It was a truly dangerous predicament.


I took a deep breath and calmed my mind.


You will never fall for me. Trust me!


This is the death ritual that you can never become proficient at without faith.


I unfolded the formula again and again.


The swords still threaten my life beyond my will, but that’s okay. Repeated training will save me more safely than any self-defense weapon.


Because my night was long.


\* \* \*


Three days later, Sima Ming came to my residence.


“Come in, sir!”


“Have you had a good rest?”


“I had a good rest.”


Actually, I should have answered like this.


Wouldn’t martial arts training be easy for a person without a sword?


Until just a moment ago, I was absorbed in martial arts training within the space-time transfer technique.




I’ve been practicing my slashing technique for the past three days, and now I can finally land it where I want. My accuracy has dropped, but at least I’m no longer at the point where my heart starts pounding.


The reason Sima Ming came was to deliver one piece of news.


“The leader has officially given his permission.”


As expected, Sima Ming’s prediction was accurate.


“Thank you! It’s all thanks to your hard work, sir.”


If he had been resolutely opposed, he would not have been able to go out this time. Even if his father had wanted it, it would not have been easy to ignore the strong opposition of the military commander. It was clearly thanks to Sima Ming’s concession.


“While you were out of the school, we will treat you as a closed-door training center. We thought about informing the Murim Alliance and the Sadomasochum, but we decided that it would be better not to inform them, considering the possibility that information might leak out.”


It was a natural decision for him, as his father’s safety was his top priority.


His caution was further enhanced.


“And the Heavenly Horse Guards will follow secretly.”


These are the ones led by Hwi. The best bodyguards in the martial arts world who are always with their father wherever he goes.


I really wanted to be alone with my father this time, but I couldn’t insist on it now. Since Sima Ming had already yielded, I should also yield. Instead, I proposed a compromise.


“Instead, let’s just follow Uncle Whee.”


I guessed why Sima Ming wanted to send them away.


The mission to protect my father is important, but more than that, it is to keep in regular contact with the school. We need to know when, where, and how he moves, so that the school can prepare for any situation.


But if it’s something like that, Hwi can easily do it on his own.


“You don’t have to worry about the escorts, they’ll be following you secretly from a distance anyway.”


“That’s not why. If they were watching us, they would pay attention to my father’s closed-door training. It’s not the right time for him to close down. If they suspect it’s a disguise, they’ll definitely check out the Heavenly Horse Guards. If they notice their absence, they’ll also notice my father’s excommunication.”


Of course, I don’t think their work will reach Cheonmajeon. I’m trying to make it as brief as possible.


Although he expected that more persuasion would be needed, Sima Ming readily agreed.




“Okay. Let’s just go with Whi Daeju.”


I made a face like, “Oh no.”


“Your Majesty, from the beginning you were only going to send out Mr. Whi.”


“If only the Great Leader had gone, the Young Leader would have made up some other excuse and gone alone with the Leader.”


“Ah! I was reading it all to you, sir.”


Sima Ming smiled at my sigh and said:


“The destination is Shaanxi.”


The island is quite far from here, so I will be able to spend plenty of time with my father.


“It’s not a matter of urgency, so you can take your time.”


He didn’t say anything about the mission, as if he thought we’d find out once we got there.


It was his consideration. It meant that until he arrived, he should stop thinking about the mission and spend time with his father.


“How would you like to move?”


“I want to go by carriage, or by foot. I want to go wherever my heart desires.”


“I will prepare it that way.”


Finally, he informed me of the time of this historic first excommunication.


“The departure is tomorrow. We will leave at dawn, sandwiched between the transport wagons heading out.”


\* \* \*


After meeting Sima Ming, I went to my father’s residence.


“Father, I am here.”


Then I heard my father’s voice from inside.


“What’s going on?”


“I came to see you because I have something to tell you, father.”


After a while, my father opened the door and came out. He looked a little flustered, unlike usual.


“Isn’t this the first time you’ve been away from the church for such a long time since becoming the leader? I’ll help you pack. I’m also an expert traveler, aren’t I?”


“Okay.”


My father turned around after refusing with a blunt face. I felt that he was treating me differently today than usual, and then I saw the inside of the room through the closing door.


Clothes were spread out on the bed, and a large leather bag was also visible. Various other items were also strewn about.


My father is packing!


I thought he sent Sima Ming to my residence instead of calling me to Cheonmajeon to conduct business secretly, but it turned out he was busy preparing for a trip.


My father is also looking forward to this trip.


I smiled brightly and spoke loudly outside the door.


“Father, don’t forget to pack your pajamas!”
