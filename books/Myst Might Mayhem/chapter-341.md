 “I’m toying with you right now.”


 ‘This… this bastard… toying with me?’


 Pain and anger intertwined, causing Tang Clan Leader Tang In-hae’s face to twist terribly.


 No matter how much of an enemy Mok Gyeong-un was, since he had become a supreme master comparable to the Six Heavens (六天), Tang In-hae thought he would keep his word.


 At the very least, if he said he would give an opportunity, Tang In-hae believed he would follow through, but that was a miscalculation.


 From the beginning, Mok Gyeong-un had humiliated him, so it was crystal clear what he would do.


 Due to his thighs being severed and his legs cut off, the bleeding was so severe that dizziness threatened to overcome him in an instant.


 -Grip!


 Tang In-hae gritted his teeth and quickly applied pressure to his thighs to stop the bleeding.


 As the blood slightly clotted from pressing on the acupuncture points, Tang In-hae shouted in a rage-filled voice,


 “As a martial artist, can’t you even keep your own words?”


 Due to past events, he wasn’t in a position to argue about cowardice in the first place, so he knew there was a flaw in his statement.


 

 This was simply to provoke Mok Gyeong-un.


 With that level of martial arts after surpassing the wall, even without two legs, he could still confront an enemy with just his arms, but that was only possible against inferiors.


 Since he was already at a disadvantage, he needed to lure Mok Gyeong-un to approach him.


 “Cowardly bastard! You have no pride as a martial artist!”


 Tang In-hae continued shouting while glaring at Mok Gyeong-un.


 ‘Come on! Come at me!’


 It was at that very moment.


 -Stab!


 “Urgh!”


 Something penetrated his severed thigh.


 Even though he had stopped the bleeding, touching an already painful area was bound to be agonizing.


 Unable to endure the pain, Tang In-hae twisted his entire body.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c4f98310f240f4d43d687", id: "pf-8947-1"}) ‘Damn it! What the hell did he do?’


 Looking at the penetrated part above his thigh, there was a blood-soaked coin.


 ‘Finger Flicking Divine Technique?’


 Finger Flicking Divine Technique.


 It was a technique that utilized something like a hidden weapon by flicking it with one’s fingers.


 Faced with Mok Gyeong-un’s response, not falling for his provocation at all, Tang In-hae gritted his teeth and tried to endure the agony somehow.


 Mok Gyeong-un spoke to him,


 “You’re already trapped prey, so you think I’ll listen to your babbling?”


 -Flip!


 With those words, Mok Gyeong-un flicked his fingers again.


 -Stab!


 “Urgh!”


 Another coin penetrated the opposite side of Tang In-hae’s thigh.


 Tang In-hae bit his lips tightly to endure the pain, but unable to withstand the agony, his body trembled.


 Seeing his state, the Eight Poison Snake Staff Guyang Sa-oh, who could be considered his lifelong rival, couldn’t help but feel pity.


 ‘How did he end up like this?’


 Although he was belligerent, the young Tang In-hae also had an ambitious side.


 However, after losing his father, the previous Clan Leader, and taking over as the new leader, he gradually changed, and aspects that Guyang Sa-oh hadn’t seen before emerged.


 Was it the passage of time and various hardships that had changed him so?


 Clicking his tongue, Guyang Sa-oh soon turned his head.


 ‘Anyway, Young Master Mok won’t fall for Tang In-hae’s provocation.’


 Anger clouds the judgment of even the wisest sage.


 But Mok Gyeong-un wasn’t someone who would fall for such tricks, so there was no need to worry.


 Except for one thing.


 ‘…It can’t be, right?’


 It was quite ambiguous when he intervened between them.


 He only hoped that they hadn’t exchanged a single palm strike at that time.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c50524a5a770dd7e4e350", id: "pf-8948-1"}) The Formless Poison (無形毒) was perfect among all existing poisons, so there was no antidote, and once poisoned, the situation was over.


 -Stab! Stab! Stab!


 “Aargh!”


 Tang In-hae writhed in pain as Mok Gyeong-un’s Finger Flicking Divine Technique continued relentlessly.


 For someone known as one of the Eight Stars, the top masters of the martial arts world, his state was utterly miserable.


 ‘What’s going on?’


 Writhing in agony, Tang In-hae grew impatient.


 That’s because he wondered when the reaction would come.


 He had definitely received the Formless Poison Technique’s sweeping strike earlier.


 Even if it wasn’t direct detoxification, once contact was made, the Formless Poison would quickly penetrate through the skin and invade the body.


 But he couldn’t understand why there was still no reaction.


 ‘Is the Formless Poison also affected by internal energy?’


 Even Jang Mun-no, the old man who could be considered almost on par with the Eight Stars, couldn’t withstand the Formless Poison despite reaching the realm of a poison master.


 Even that bastard who had chased after him to interfere was the same.


 Wasn’t he even given the title of one of the Eight Stars?


 Even those individuals couldn’t endure for long, so if one had surpassed the wall’s wall and reached a realm comparable to the Six Heavens, was it different?


 ‘Could it be that he blocked the Formless Poison from invading his body with his profound true energy?’


 Seeing no reaction until now, there was no other explanation.


 Just how profound must one’s true energy be to block the Formless Poison from invading?


 -Gnash!


 Then, enduring it like this wouldn’t solve anything.


 He had to somehow make the bastard directly detoxify the Formless Poison to turn the situation around.


 Thus, Tang In-hae decided to take a risk, even if it was somewhat dangerous.


 “Haa… haa… Jang Mun-no… that… old man… raised… a truly… trashy bastard…”


 “…”


 As soon as he finished speaking, Mok Gyeong-un, who had been flicking his fingers, stopped.


 Thinking that he had nothing to lose, Tang In-hae immediately continued speaking when he saw a reaction.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) “Why? Did the Clan Leader… haa… say something wrong? Well… a maggot… who coveted… our clan’s… martial arts… without knowing his place… and grew up… under him… is no different. A maggot and trash…”


 -Whoosh!


 -Shudder!


 At that moment, the tremendous killing intent surging in all directions rendered Tang In-hae unable to continue speaking.


 Although he had deliberately provoked him, what was this?


 How could killing intent be this intense?


 It felt like death was right beside him.


 “Huff! Huff! Huff!”


 Even breathing became difficult.


 The bastard’s anger was palpable.


 But then…


 -Swish!


 Tang In-hae’s body slowly floated upward due to Mok Gyeong-un’s true energy.


 It was the Seizing Objects in Mid-Air technique.


 Feeling the true energy constricting and pressuring his body, Tang In-hae momentarily unleashed his rebound energy to repel it.


 -Boom!


 -Thud!


 

 Falling to the ground with a thud, Tang In-hae gritted his teeth.


 Had he been enduring humiliation and simply taking the Finger Flicking Divine Technique all this time?


 While waiting for the Formless Poison to spread, he also aimed to recover some of his true energy depleted from fighting Guyang Sa-oh.


 ‘Even if you’re a step above me, I’ve also surpassed the wall.’


 Even if he tried to restrain him with true energy, he could break free to this extent.


 If he truly wanted to capture him, he would have to come in person.


 Just as he thought that…


 -Tremble!


 At that moment, Tang In-hae felt his entire skin, no, his flesh, trembling like crazy.


 Was he going to use Seizing Objects in Mid-Air again?


 He should know it’s useless…


 -Boom!


 It was at that instant.


 His body suddenly flew backward as if it were a cannonball.


 It happened in the blink of an eye, and as soon as he felt his body flying, the surroundings he had seen passed by in a blur.


 Then…


 -Crash!


 “Ugh!”


 He collided with something with his back, and along with the sound of it shattering, numerous figures appeared around him.


 Upon seeing those figures, Tang In-hae couldn’t hide his bewilderment.


 They were none other than the executives and warriors of the Tang Clan.


 “Clan… Clan Leader!”


 “Clan Leader!”


 Calls for him resounded from all around.


 Quickly scanning his surroundings, Tang In-hae realized that he had somehow arrived at the rear courtyard in front of the back gate of the Tang Clan.


 ‘He sent me flying here before I could even release my true energy?’


 “Ha…”


 He was truly a monster, enough to elicit exclamations, even if he was an enemy.


 But then, an immense pressure was felt behind his back.


 Tang In-hae instinctively knew that Mok Gyeong-un was standing behind him.


 The distance wasn’t that close yet.


 He needed to get within ten steps to unleash the secret technique that could definitively detoxify the Formless Poison.


 ‘I need to provoke him…’


 Tang In-hae bit his lip tightly.


 He hadn’t expected the bastard to send him flying to the Tang Clan.


 He was already feeling guilty for not fulfilling his duties as the Clan Leader and attempting to flee by abandoning his clan members.


 But being dropped in the midst of them, he couldn’t bring himself to open his mouth.


 At that moment…


 “H-How dare you do this to the Clan Leader?”


 While everyone was rendered speechless by Mok Gyeong-un’s immense pressure, someone shouted courageously.


 It was none other than Tang Cheol-yong, the Deputy Clan Leader of the Tang Clan.


 As Tang In-hae’s right-hand man, Tang Cheol-yong was deeply loyal, so he barely suppressed his fear and spoke up.


 With hundreds of people gathered, one person’s courage was enough to ignite a small flame in the hearts of others.


 -Swish! Swish! Clang! Clang!


 The Tang Clan warriors soon assumed their stances and drew their weapons.


 Having already witnessed Mok Gyeong-un’s monstrous power with their own eyes, they couldn’t shout arrogantly, but they could still muster the resolve to risk their lives in this way.


 Seeing this, Tang In-hae’s eyes and lips trembled.


 ‘…Damn it.’


 He had ruthlessly abandoned them for his own greed.


 Yet they were drawing their weapons and mustering courage for him without any suspicion.


 No matter how selfish he was, he couldn’t help but be shaken by that sight.


 -Grip!


 It would have been much easier if they had hated him.


 But then, Mok Gyeong-un’s voice reached his ears.


 -Unlike someone, they are very loyal. Someone ran away with their tail between their legs, abandoning all their clan members to save themselves.


 ‘…’


 -They’ve been together for so long, yet they don’t even know what kind of person their Clan Leader is. How unfortunate.


 -Gnash!


 Tang In-hae gritted his teeth so hard that his molars nearly cracked.


 The karmic consequences of his actions were coming back to him like fate, but he wanted to somehow stop it.


 At the very least, he wanted to remain as the Sichuan Tang Clan Leader in their eyes, not in a humiliating state.


 Thus…


 -Rumble!


 Tang Clan Leader Tang In-hae circulated his true energy throughout his body and drew upon the power of the Formless Poison Technique.


 He decided not to wait for the bastard to approach him.


 He was determined not to think about turning the tables or anything like that anymore.


 He just wanted to kill this bastard…


 -Swish!


 ‘!?’


 At that moment, Tang In-hae’s eyes trembled.


 Mok Gyeong-un was already standing behind Tang Cheol-yong, who could be considered his right-hand man.


 -Gulp!


 Deputy Clan Leader Tang Cheol-yong swallowed dry saliva.


 No matter how vast the gap in martial arts, there was no way he couldn’t sense the overwhelming pressure from behind.


 -Swish!


 Then, Mok Gyeong-un lightly grasped the back of his neck.


 Nevertheless, Tang Cheol-yong couldn’t move an inch from that spot.


 Tang In-hae hurriedly shouted,


 “Stop!”


 “Stop what?”


 “Please… please take your hand off Cheol-yong. I… I will pay any price… just don’t do it this way.”


 “What price do you have to pay?”


 “…”


 At Mok Gyeong-un’s words, Tang Clan Leader Tang In-hae’s face turned pale.


 

  Was this bastard trying to make him confess everything with his own mouth?


New n𝙤vel chapters are published on freeweɓnøvel.com.

 -Grip!


 Blood flowed from Tang In-hae’s clenched fists as he applied more force.


 The damn bastard was trying to send him to the depths of hell…


 It was at that very moment.


 “From now on, all the tragedies that befall the Tang Clan will be the fault of a single person.”


 ‘!?’


 -Crack! Crunch!


 “St-Stop… Aaaaargh!”


 -Rip! Crunch!


 The scream abruptly ceased as Deputy Clan Leader Tang Cheol-yong’s head was torn off along with his spine.


 ‘!!!!!!’
