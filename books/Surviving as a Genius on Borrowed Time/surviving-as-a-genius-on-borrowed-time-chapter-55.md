# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 55 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Jeong Yeon-shin, cùng với các sư huynh đệ áo xanh, Ma Gwang-ik, Myeolseomdaeju và Changcheondaeju, bàn luận về kiếm pháp của cậu. Mọi người đều kinh ngạc trước khả năng điều khiển chân khí (internal energy) tinh tế của cậu, nhưng cũng lo ngại về việc tiêu hao năng lượng lớn và khả năng gây hại cho đồng đội. Myeolseomdaeju quyết định cử thêm hai người nữa cùng Jeong Yeon-shin đến chi nhánh Hwangbo ở Tấn An Bình Âm, và ra lệnh cho cậu chứng minh năng lực của mình.

Sau khi rời khỏi các đại nhân, Margin hỏi Jeong Yeon-shin về âm thanh đặc biệt trong kiếm pháp của cậu. Cậu xác nhận mình tạo ra nó và Margin trách cậu không nói sớm hơn. Margin cảnh báo Jeong Yeon-shin về những thế lực thù địch trong giang hồ (Kang-ho), đặc biệt là những người đang điều tra về Nhập Hoàng Thành (Ip-Hwang-Seong). Margin kể tên một vài thế lực như Phái Bạch Kiếm (Paekgeomjong), Tầm Mưu Liên (Simmuryeon) và Huyết Viêm Giáo (Blood Flame Sect), đồng thời nhắc nhở cậu về việc một cao thủ của Tầm Mưu Liên từng bị giết. Margin cũng nhắc nhở cậu cẩn thận với Thất Sát Đồ (Chilsado) của Huyết Viêm Giáo.

Margin lo lắng vì Jeong Yeon-shin tạo ra quá nhiều kẻ thù trong thời gian ngắn. Jeong Yeon-shin nhận thức được điều này, nhưng cậu coi đó là động lực để mạnh mẽ hơn. Cậu coi Hoàng Bộ Thế Gia (Hwangbo Se-ga) cũng là một thế lực tà đạo (Sapa) cần phải tiêu diệt. Sau đó, cậu tập trung vào việc luyện tập kiếm pháp và điều khiển chân khí.

Ba ngày sau trận chiến ở bình nguyên, Myeolseomdaeju thông báo Heonwonchang và Shinsobin không được tham gia nhiệm vụ tấn công Hwangbo Se-ga, thay vào đó họ sẽ ở lại bảo vệ doanh trại. Jeong Yeon-shin nhận được lời khuyên từ một sư huynh áo xanh về đặc điểm võ công của chi nhánh Bình Âm (Pyeong-eum) của Hwangbo, chủ yếu là kiếm nặng, và các huyệt đạo cần lưu ý.

Jeong Yeon-shin, Cheongmyeong và Baekmiryeo đến Tấn An, Sơn Đông (Shandong). Khung cảnh ở đây rất tiêu điều, hầu như không có dấu hiệu của sự sống. Baek Mi-ryeo giải thích vị trí của Hoàng Bộ Gia Trang (Hwangbo clan) gần Hoàng Hà (Yellow River), gây khó khăn cho việc trốn thoát bằng thuyền. Cheongmyeong nói rằng việc người dân bị bắt đi lao dịch là sự thật đã được xác nhận. Jeong Yeon-shin quyết định đến Hwangbo Se-ga để tìm hiểu sự thật.

Cả ba cùng xông thẳng vào Hwangbo Gia Trang. Jeong Yeon-shin, sử dụng Sihwamugeukkwon Jinbyeok’s Gugyeol, phá tan cánh cổng. Họ chứng kiến một cảnh tượng kỳ lạ: một bữa tiệc rượu đang diễn ra trong sân, với những người đang vui vẻ uống rượu bên cạnh một cái ao trang trí kỳ dị. Một người đàn ông quý tộc, Ji-hyeon, lên tiếng chào đón họ một cách mỉa mai, hỏi tại sao họ không báo cáo sự việc lên Nhập Hoàng Thành mà lại đến đây gây sự. Jeong Yeon-shin im lặng, trong khi Cheongmyeong và Baekmiryeo cũng không biết nói gì.

Those who fell while standing were especially in danger. The blue-clad masters who seemed to have lost their minds for a moment quickly grabbed the bodies of their juniors.


The internal energy barrier, like a self-defense device, arises through thought.


If he had lost consciousness, the White Knight would have been no different from a third-rate warrior.


The external state of the Diamond Indestructible, where the entire body becomes as solid as a diamond, only existed in rumors.


The faces of the blue-collared masters who were looking after their juniors were filled with confusion.


“······It’s the sound of the sound.”


“How can you do that? So detailed and precise?”


“A strange application of the sword’s aerodynamic enhancement. To that extent, it’s beyond the realm of the ninefold.”


Their story already had insight into the essence of martial arts. That was the state of the blue realm of Ip Hwang Seong.


It was said that those who were more talented than anyone else in their hometown devoted their lives to martial arts.




They were people who would be called masters anywhere in the vast world of martial arts.


The first thing to do was to see through the principles of ignorance. Whether it was envy or admiration, it came after that.


Finally, the blue-collar workers began to look at each other and talk.


“It’s a martial art I’ve never heard of. If it’s even capable of piercing the white self-defense device······.”


“It’s a white-colored one, so it ended in fainting. It will truly show an overwhelming appearance. This will be even more so in a group battle where there are no other masters of the same level or higher. There will be many restrictions, but its strengths are clear.”


“The problem is causing harm to allies. Isn’t it worth mentioning solo missions?”


He does not hesitate to discuss martial arts even in front of great lords.


I just told the truth. It was something that no one in the Imperial Palace could criticize.


“······It seems like it consumes a lot of mental energy.”


Myeolseomdaeju looked at Jeongyeonshin blankly and opened his mouth. Jeongyeonshin nodded in response.




It was not a mistake. The act of causing a sword attack while carrying a radiant energy was an art that was impossible with ordinary senses.


The sword required extreme concentration. Even Jeongyeonshin felt quite tired after casting it once.


“It’s such a detailed use of the energy. Of course. It would be difficult to use it unexpectedly in a melee. It would be better to detonate it at the start of a fight. It would also have the effect of lowering morale.”


Before I knew it, he was giving me advice. He seemed very interested.


“Even so, I can’t just send one island. The mission isn’t easy.”


It was the Great Lord of Changcheon who was looking at Jeongyeonshin while rubbing his chin with his hand. The Great Lord of Myeolseom nodded.


“I’ll just add two more. The mission is to attack the Huangbo branch of Jinan Pingyin County. Are there any volunteers?”


There were many people who raised their hands at that moment. There must have been at least thirty of them.


Not only Ma Gwang-ik, but also people from Myeolseomdae and Changcheondae came to support him.


It was the sound of the sword. Perhaps he wanted to see the martial arts he had never heard of in real life. Several of the blue masters laughed awkwardly.




“Ma Gwang-ik would be better. It would be right for Ma Dae-ju to decide.”


“There is no other way than to use the Magic Light Sword that matches your hands and feet. It would be good to use the Ilryeon Sword and the Cheongan Demon Sword.”


“Do as you wish. Then······.”


The eyes of the Mysterious Land Lord, which were gleaming black, turned towards Jeong Yeon-shin.


“Show that it wasn’t an overreach. Prove it with force. So that no one will blame you for being reckless.”


He turned around and said, the hem of his dark robe fluttering without a trace.


“Thank you for your consideration.”


Jeong Yeon-shin, who had put away the Bukmyeonggeom, swung it at his seniors, including several great lords.


“Where did you learn that? It’s not in my nature to be so ignorant.”


“Is this the secret of the Iphwangma family?”


When the blue-haired masters approached with curious faces, Margin’s body blocked them.


He moved Jeongyeonshin to another place.


Several seniors stopped with expressions of regret.


It was revealed that the blood of the Iphwangma was flowing through Jeongyeonshin’s body as part of a ritual. No one found it strange.


The margin that reached the entrance of the mountain range connected to the plain asked small questions.


“That sound. Did you create it?”


“yes.”


Jeong Yeon-shin answered calmly. The scar on Margin’s face twitched.


“Why didn’t you tell me sooner?”


“What kind of martial artist goes around revealing all of his martial arts skills? He would be destroyed and likely die. This time, there was nothing I could do. I didn’t even think about it.”




“······You’re not wrong.”


“Is that why you came to me alone to ask me that?”


“That’s a different story.”


Margin shook his head and opened his mouth.


“Yeonshin, you almost died on this mission. Listen. Long-lived martial artists are often well aware of their own grudges.”


“······.”


Jeong Yeon-shin’s eyebrows furrowed when she heard the word longevity.


“You, Kang-ho’s reaction is unusual. The fight between the martial arts forces is not just an all-out war. The battle between the sources is no different. I heard from the General Office. They say there are people who are investigating the movements of Ip-Hwang-Seong Seom-Ye.”


“If it’s Eunwon······?”


“The only ones I’ve heard of right now are the Paekgeomjong, Simmuryeon, and the Blood Flame Sect. The disciple of the Paekgeomjong and the Palhyeongnachalgeom were great. However, both of them are descendants of schools with a thick layer of warriors even within the Paekgeomjong. There are bound to be a lot of people sharpening their swords.”


“I know Sim Mu-ryeon. He once cut off the head of one of the later indexes there.”


“It was called Geomyehwa. I heard that she was famous in the Hogwang and Hanam areas for her beauty and swordsmanship. It seems that she had a fiancé. We need to be careful not only of the head of the family, Seongga, but also of the man who was her lover.”


“······.”


Jeong Yeon-shin nodded silently.


“The most annoying thing is the Blood Flame Cult. If you didn’t have the Mingjeongdan, you would have had to return to Iphwangseong.”

Margin continued speaking calmly.


“There was no one like you, Myeolma Cheonggangsu. You were bound to be a target. You could have met Chilsado during the Yongbongjihoe. It was very fortunate that you avoided that witch. That’s because the Blood Flame Sect’s apostles were working hard to expand their influence throughout the Central Plains. The distance must have been considerable.”


“That’s right. We’re not at the level where we can face the Apostle yet.”


When the Myulmacheonggangsu was first revealed, it blew out the eyes of the Seven Sado.


Her carelessness and chaos were a blessing in disguise.


Jeong Yeon-shin realized once again that there were many people who considered her an enemy.


They are not usually enemies. They are the Thirteen Heavenly Kings of the Four Sects, comparable to the Nine Sects and the Eight Legions.


“If you want to lead a martial world, it’s something you have to deal with. Even so, you’re overdoing it. It wouldn’t be easy to find a precedent for creating that many powerful enemies in such a short period of time. Especially at your age.”


“It sounds like you’re doing your job properly.”


“Now you are truly a martial artist. There are many who hold a grudge against you. You must always be on your guard when you come out into the world of martial arts. Keep that in mind.”


There was a hint of concern in Margin’s voice.


Jeongyeon Shin nodded her head coolly.


‘I ran without stopping.’


Before doing that again, I felt like I had sharpened the knife in my heart for a moment.


I was glad that the enemies were all the same, the Thirteen Thousand, the giant wave of Sapha.


The Paegeomjong and Blood Flame Cult were also his enemies, and the more he cut off their heads, the more achievements he would accumulate.


‘Isn’t Hwangbo Se-ga also a Sapa?’


He returned to the group with Margin and immersed himself in mental training.


It was to use the sword effectively. It was necessary to continuously practice the use of the true energy.


Jeongyeonshin was growing stronger, despite Margin’s warning.




“White is out of the equation.”


It was the voice of the Extinction Commander. He was beginning to organize the mission.


Heonwonchang and Shinsobin were drafted. They were unable to participate in the mission to attack Hwangbo Se-ga.


Hwangbo Se, who had become a defeated soldier with the Yongbong branch, took on the role of holding onto the escort group.


Jeongyeonshin had to separately seek advice from the blue senior of the Myeolseomdae.


“The martial arts inherited by the Pyeong-eum branch were mainly called heavy swords. If you lightly block, you will most likely be pushed back. Remember Gok-ji, Cheok-taek, and So-hae. As you can see, they are the acupoints of the arm joints. Store your true energy firmly and exchange sword strikes.”


He mastered the martial arts characteristics of the Pyeongumhyeon Hwangbo branch. It didn’t take long.


\* \* \*


Three days have passed since the Battle of the Plains.


“They really left us alone. It seems like your yin yang was quite trustworthy.”


Cheongmyeong laughed with an expression of amusement.


The three blue warriors of the Magwangiljo clan, including Jeong Yeon-sin, had arrived in the southern part of Shandong Province.


It was a quiet street with hardly any signs of life.


Pyeongumhyeon, where the mission objective was being established, was truly quiet.


The merchants who spread out their stalls and spread out their goods were usually elderly middle-aged men or old women.


Baek Mi-ryeo stroked her long hair.


She said, glancing at the ornaments on display.


“Janggu (章丘), where the Hwangbo clan is located, is adjacent to the Yellow River. It’s a wide river. It’ll be a headache if you try to escape by boat. If you want to secretly control the area near the river, it’s best to send only the minimum number of people to establish a branch family.”


They say spring in Shandong Province is dry. The atmosphere in the market felt even drier.


The villagers who were staring blankly at the group with swords didn’t even look scared.




Their faces, wrinkled as if they were worn out, had no life in them.


“······I don’t see any men. They must have really been taken away for forced labor.”


“This is something that Changcheondae and the General Office have confirmed several times. It can’t be wrong. If it weren’t for the Murim Sega, the Imperial Army would have risen up. If the army goes out, it won’t be good for the people’s lives, so it’s a good thing.”


Cheongmyeong said calmly.


In fact, Jeong Yeon-shin was considering covering up the sign of the Emperor’s throne again.


It was like that until we reached Pyeongumhyeon. It was different from the missions we had done so far, involving Sapha 13cheon.


Hwangbo Se-ga was a famous family in the martial arts world. I wanted to see the truth.


“I guess I can just go to Hwangbo’s branch and ask them what’s going on.”


widely!


As Jeong Yeon-shin finished speaking, the three of them stepped forward at the same time. Their steps were brisk and full of energy.


The energy that filled the veins of my body all the way to my toes began to push my body forward. The speed gradually increased.


Only then did the people around him startle him so much that they began to move away rapidly.


Ji-hyeon, who had the duty to report the people’s livelihood to the royal family without hiding anything, was placed second.


I’ve heard a lot about Ji-hyeon of Pyeong-eum-hyeon here. He’s a very unique person.


If what I know is correct, Jihyun will also be in the Hwangbo branch.


We headed straight to the manor that housed the largest group of pavilions in the village.


Even though there was no signboard hanging, I felt that it was a martial arts world. It was because I could feel the energy of internal energy from within.


Wow!


In an instant, Jeongyeonshin’s gallop overtook the two.


The mission was to adapt the Dokmun sound of Ma Gwang-ik’s island art to real life.




Jeong Yeon-shin did not want to disappoint the two people’s expectations as she was grateful for the opportunity.


He used the Sihwamugeukkwon Jinbyeok’s Gugyeol as it was.


bang!


The shattered door fragments were scattered in all directions. It looked as if a storm had struck due to the powerful force of the waves.


Jeongyeon Shin stopped for a moment at the sight that was immediately revealed.


A drinking party was held in a large yard in front of the main gate. A small pond in one corner caught my eye.


It was a place decorated with carvings of all kinds of spirits.


Among the grasses by the pond, you could see not only the four guardian deities and the giraffe, but also a strange beast with strange wings.


There were people sitting on large rocks surrounding the pond, holding glasses of wine.


He didn’t stop drinking even after seeing the group.


“ah.”


Among the five beautifully dressed women, the one who had been smiling raised his head.


He was a handsome man of noble birth who had a yellow cornelian cherry blossom pinned behind his long ears.


The servants who were busily going about the surroundings glanced at Jeong Yeon-shin and her party, then continued with their work in silence.


“Our Jinam warriors have come again today. The gate is still open!”


The nobleman raised his hand. The sleeves of his lime-colored robe fluttered.


He continued to speak as if he was dealing with something very familiar.


“Why didn’t you just get out of Shandong and report to a place like Iphwangseong? I just can’t figure it out. What confidence do the lower classes have to challenge Hwangbo Sega?”


“······.”


Jeongyeonshin was silent for a moment. Cheongmyeong and Baekmirye also seemed unable to say anything.
