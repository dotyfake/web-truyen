## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Sau khi đến trấn, nhân vật chính cùng nhóm của mình thong thả đi vào "Làng Akingok (Akingok Village)", nơi ẩn chứa nhiều nguy hiểm. Nhận thấy những ánh mắt dò xét, họ biết rằng có nhiều kẻ đang rình mò, chờ cơ hội tấn công để nhận tiền thưởng từ chủ nhân của Ác Khúc (Evil Song).

Trên đường đi, họ liên tục bị phục kích. Một nhóm người giả vờ vui vẻ uống rượu đã bị Huyết Thiên Đao (Bloodthirsty Demon) nhanh chóng hạ gục. Tiếp đó, Kiếm Thánh (Sword Master) sử dụng kiếm khí tiêu diệt những kẻ mai phục trong rừng. Khi một con hắc long (dark dragon) bất ngờ xuất hiện, Xích Ma (Chwima) đã ra tay nhanh gọn, khiến chúng "uống thuốc ngủ".

Đến bờ sông Naruto, họ tìm được một chiếc thuyền. Trong lúc nhân vật chính chèo thuyền, Xích Ma khen Huyết Thiên Đao vẫn giữ được vẻ chính trực, khiến Huyết Thiên Đao bối rối. Nhất Hoa Kiếm Tôn (Ilhwageomjon) nhắc nhở Huyết Thiên Đao nên nói lời cảm ơn, và Huyết Thiên Đao đã làm theo. Nhân vật chính nhận thấy Xích Ma đang cố gắng hòa giải mối quan hệ giữa các thành viên.

Khi thuyền ra giữa sông, Thủy Quỷ Hoàng Hà (Yellow River Water Ghosts) tấn công, nhưng nhân vật chính đã dùng kỹ năng kết hợp khinh công và thượng thừa để đánh bại chúng. Đến bờ bên kia, Ngũ Ác Trùng Khánh (Five Evils of Chongqing) xuất hiện chặn đường. Huyết Thiên Đao nhận ra chúng là những kẻ từng gây tội ác ở Trùng Khánh. Ác Soma (evil Soma) dùng huyết phong (bloody winds) giết chết Tứ Ác (Sasa), Nhất Hoa Kiếm Tôn chém đầu Nhị Ác (Isa), nhân vật chính dùng Trường Thiên Thức (Changcheonsik) giết chết Tam Ác (Osa), và Xích Ma phá nát đầu Tam Ác (Samsa). Huyết Thiên Đao sau đó dễ dàng giết chết thủ lĩnh của Ngũ Ác, Nhất Tà (Ilsa).

Nhân vật chính nhận thấy các thành viên trong nhóm phối hợp với nhau rất ăn ý và cẩn thận quan sát kỹ thuật của đối phương. Anh không cố gắng che giấu hoàn toàn kỹ năng của mình, vì anh muốn họ tin tưởng và đi theo mình.

Tiếp tục lên đường, họ bị tấn công bằng độc khói, nhưng Huyết Thiên Đao và Nhất Hoa Kiếm Tôn đã hợp lực đẩy độc khói ngược trở lại, giết chết những kẻ tấn công. Đây là lần đầu tiên hai người họ phối hợp chiến đấu kể từ khi gia nhập nhóm, và ánh mắt họ nhìn nhau trở nên dịu dàng hơn.

Trước dinh thự của Ác Khúc, hàng trăm kẻ ác xuất hiện, bao gồm Quỷ Thương Cự Hán (giant ghost spearman), Ảnh Nguyệt (Eunwol) thủ lĩnh thích khách, những kẻ nghiện ma túy, nhóm thợ săn toàn nữ, và đám ăn mày. Tuy nhiên, tất cả đều e dè trước khí thế của nhóm nhân vật chính. Huyết Thiên Đao thách thức chúng tấn công, và nhóm của anh bắt đầu thi triển tuyệt kỹ. Khí thế của năm người lan tỏa khiến những kẻ ác phải lùi bước.

Nhóm của nhân vật chính tiếp tục tiến về dinh thự của Ác Khúc. Ác Soma phá hủy tấm biển "Ác Nhân Tương Trợ (Even evildoers help each other)", và một thành viên khác phá sập cổng chính. Ác Soma tự tin tuyên bố rằng nếu Ác Khúc đã chuẩn bị sẵn sàng, thì họ nên từ bỏ vị trí của mình.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-150/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-152/)Episode 151 When we are together.




The town was ordinary. No, it looked ordinary.


There were pedestrians, merchants, and even children running around.


Just looking at this sight, no one would think that this is the ‘Akingok Village’.


However, at first glance, it may seem like an ordinary village, but the gazes, glances, and feelings of those passing by were not ordinary.


We felt our eyes secretly exchanged glances, but we pretended not to notice and walked along the road.


“Not everyone here follows the evil spirits. Rather, there are many who are eagerly eyeing that spot. You can think of it as being similar to a green forest.”


That’s why I didn’t run into the light air.


We made sure that our movement was not considered an invasion or an attack. If it was, all the villains in the Evil Song would come forward. Like it or not, they would come forward and try to protect their lair.


But we were just walking around as strangers. This difference was a huge difference, and it was a strategy that could be chosen because there was a very evil Soma who knew the physiology of the evil song better than anyone else.


As I was walking along the road, I saw a dozen men and women sitting in a vacant lot drinking alcohol. They were laughing and chatting loudly, as if they were having so much fun and enjoying themselves.




The moment we passed them.


They jumped up and tried to throw the weapon. But before the weapon could escape their hands,


Shhhhh.


Kwakwakwakwa!


Before they could do so, the Bloodthirsty Demon’s sword swept through them. We had already prepared for their ambush.


The acting was okay, as they were laughing, talking, and playing, but no one paid any attention to us as we passed by. If there were two or three people, it might have been okay, but if there were ten or so people sitting there and not a single person looked at them, it would have been unnatural.


“Most of the villains in the Evil Song are people who would sell their souls for money. The owner of the Evil Song probably put up a bounty in anticipation of our arrival.”


I said with a laugh at the explanation of the evil Soma.


“I’d have to bet a million nyang.”


Then Chwima said.




“Of course, per person?”


As they walked along joking like that, ambushers jumped out again from the forest on both sides.


This time, the Sword Master flew up lightly and spun around in the air, sending out sword energy. The sword spun around with her, spraying sword energy in all directions.


Those who rushed in were cut down by the sword and fell to their deaths, but not a single sword missed.


The Sword Master again came down to the place where he was walking with graceful movements.


We continued walking as if nothing had happened.


“Even if the wicked musician is not the richest in the world, how can he bet a million nyang per person?”


“So that’s why only these types of people are flocking here.”


The moment Chwima spoke, a dark dragon flew in from the bushes in front.


We all slightly twisted our bodies to dodge. The dark spirits escaped between the five of us. They flew at us so fiercely that it seemed impossible to avoid them, but we all moved lightly to dodge them.




This time, the horse moved. His new form flashed and disappeared into the bushes. Then, he returned to his original position even faster than when he entered. There was not even a single scream, as if he had somehow defeated the ambush.


He came back out and said while having a drink.


“I gave them all a drink, so they drank it and went to sleep.”


I have never properly seen Chwima fight, but just looking at him, I can tell that he is someone whose martial arts skills should not be underestimated.


So I started walking again and arrived at Naruto.


“From here, you have to take a boat and cross the river.”


We crossed the river in a boat we found at Naruto.


“I, the youngest one, will row.”


As he watched me rowing, Hyeolcheondoma said:


“When did you learn how to handle a boat? You seem very familiar with it.”


“What can’t I do?”


The other three Amazons stared at me.


“Why are you all looking at me like that? That’s why I… I’m better at it. I like being the center of attention.”


I made a joke, but everyone looked at me with a strange look. It must be because I have so little, even though I can do everything.


The boat cut through the water so quickly.


Chwima, who had been staring at the river for a moment, suddenly spoke to Hyeolcheondoma.


“This time, I saw you going out to meet the enemies, and you still look upright.”


When Chwima suddenly praised himself, Hyeoncheondoma looked visibly flustered.


“I don’t drink much.”


Then Ilhwageomjon said.




“In times like that, just say thank you. How come your temper doesn’t diminish with age?”


He did interfere, but in a gentle tone. If it had been another time, he would have been even more nitpicky, but this time, Hyeolcheondoma took a step back.


“Thank you.”


I simply said thank you to the drunkard.


“Don’t worry. I just said what I felt.”


Ilhwageomjon looked at Hyeolcheondoma with an expression asking what was going on.


I could feel that Chuma was putting in effort. That effort was making a difference.


My eyes met Chwima’s. Thank you, hyung. You’re doing well.


The raids continued.


As the boat reached the middle of the river, the raiders jumped out of the water and fired their flags.


This time I flew up with the oar in my hand and struck them down.


He hit him, stepped on him, hit another one, stepped on him again, and hit him again. It didn’t seem like much, but it was a technique that combined extreme ascension techniques and lightness techniques.


Those who jumped like that were all hit by the oar, their heads burst, and they fell into the water. They were the Yellow River Water Ghosts (黃河水鬼) who roamed the Yellow River area, wearing fish-scale costumes. They plundered passing ships and slaughtered passengers, and they were eventually chased to Akingok to live.


The very moment I was getting off the boat.


Bam!

The ferry we were on was wrecked with a loud crash.


All of the demons and I flew up. The water demons popped their heads out of the water and shot poisonous stingers from the pipes in their mouths.


Pick pick pick pick pick pick!


But there was no one who could take the poisonous sting. He moved his body in the air and avoided all the ambush attacks. This time, the one who stepped forward was the evil Soma.


Ping! Ping! Ping! Ping!


Bloody winds were continuously emitted. I realized for the first time that the winds of the evil soma could be emitted continuously like this.


Those who had shot the poison floated up like dead fish.


The Mazones and I each stood on pieces of the broken ship. Even though we stood on pieces smaller than a person’s forearm, we did not sink.


Choaaaaaaaaaah.


The tree carrying the demons split the water and moved forward.


There were water demons sticking their heads out of the water far behind us, but they didn’t dare attack us. Just the method of using broken pieces of wood to cross the river was enough to make us lose our will to fight.


So we arrived at the other side of the river in no time.


It was about a hundred feet away that those whose names could be recognized stood in front of us.


The new technique displayed by the five unmanned personnel blocking the way was not ordinary.


The Bloodthirsty Demon recognized them.


“The Five Evils of Chongqing!”


They were people who had committed evil deeds based in the Chongqing area in the past.


“As time goes by, few people recognize us. Old man, who are you?”


“You forgot me.”


“Do you know me?”




Bloodthirsty Horseman just smiled faintly.


“Seeing the things that are stopping us, it seems that as we grow older, our judgment becomes as clouded as our memory.”


Ilsa’s expression hardened.


He set out to kill her, but for some reason he felt uneasy. He was sure he had seen the old man somewhere, but he couldn’t remember him.


“Kill him!”


Although it was an order given by Ilsa to his subordinates, it ultimately became an order given to the demons.


As soon as he finished speaking, we started dealing with each person one by one.


The evil soma unleashed a bloody blast. Unable to avoid the bloody blast that was emitted from a nearby location, Sasa’s forehead was pierced and he fell. Ilhwageomjeon’s swordsmanship cut off Isa’s neck, and my Changcheonsik split Osa’s chest in the blink of an eye. The bloody blast of Chwima’s sword broke Samsa’s head and he fell.


The only one left was Ilsa. The moment they died, he remembered.


“Ah! You… … Why are you here?”


His voice trembled. There was a time when the Blood Heavenly Sword shook the world of martial arts. At that time, we couldn’t even make eye contact, but after many years, we met again here.


Ilsa tried to fly away in a hurry, but was torn in half by the great sword of the Blood Heavenly Sword.


I felt one thing while fighting together. They seemed to be fighting without thinking, but the demons were aware of each other. They used each move carefully, and they watched carefully, pretending not to see what techniques the opponent was using. In a sense, the opponents they cared about were not the villains of the evil song, but each other. And the thing they were watching the most closely was my movements and martial arts.


Even so, I didn’t bother to hide my skills. I didn’t show everything, but I didn’t try to reduce my skills either. I was the one who would be their leader. They had to trust me and follow me.


This time, those who use poison attacked.


A few of the guys who had been hiding showed up and sprayed poison smoke at us.


As Bloodthirsty Sword Master and Ilhwa Sword Master came out at the same time and swung their sleeves, the flying poisonous smoke flew towards those who had sprayed it.


Then they fell down in pain, blood spurting from every orifice in their bodies.


This is the first time since they entered here that Blood Heavenly Sword and Ilhwa Sword have teamed up to fight the enemy. They looked at each other. The gazes they had for each other were becoming softer and softer.


“If you just pass that field, you will find the residence of the evil shaman.”




A group of villains holding spears poured out from one side, leaving behind a hundred or so of the villain’s dwelling places.


The huge man in the lead was holding a spear as large as a pillar.


He was a giant ghost spearman who was notorious in the martial arts world for his single spear. He was a master of the Sapa and a master of spearmanship. However, he was branded a public enemy of the martial arts world for attacking the headquarters of the martial arts alliance and disappeared, but he has now appeared here in Akingok.


Dozens of villains appeared on the other side. They were assassins, wearing black uniforms and masks with only their eyes showing. The one leading them was Eunwol. He was once known as the most skilled assassin, and he was leading an assassin organization here.


Those who appeared from another direction were wearing only their underwear. They were standing there with their eyes blank, and they were under the influence of drugs.


However, if you let your guard down because of their appearance, you will end up being torn to pieces by them. They are much more skilled in martial arts than they look, and they do not feel pain even when stabbed by a sword. If they decide to charge like crazy, there are not many people who can handle their momentum.


Not only them, but this time a group consisting only of women also appeared, some dressed as hunters, and a group of beggars.


Those who appeared were not those who received orders from the evil song master, but rather those who each lived with their own power. They fought each other and tried to seize the hegemony of the evil song.


It was also because of these people that he felt his position was in danger after the death of the evil lord’s followers.


Although the murderous intent and aggression directed at us was unusual, the demons were not shaken at all.


The evil Soma, wearing a blood-stained mask, looked at them with his arms crossed in a haughty manner. His composure was overwhelming to his opponents.


The same was true for the other demons. Just by standing there, hundreds of villains were afraid to attack.


Bloodthirsty Horse stepped forward and shouted loudly.


“If you’re going to attack, attack all at once.”


Woooooooooooo!


A river crossing occurred on the hanging path of destruction.


His gait was as red as blood. It was the first time I saw his gait, and it was really strong and impressive because it was as red as blood.


Starting with him, the demons each uttered their prayers. Even the Baekhwageom of Ilhwageomjeon had a sword scepter. Her sword scepter was pure white. It was a color that suited her very well.


As the momentum of the five of us spread out in all directions, the villains retreated further as if pushed by a silent aura.


If I had come alone or with the evil Soma, we would have had to fight all of them.




But since you came with your demon lord, no one dared attack us.


Hundreds of people gathered, but they didn’t dare to attack and just watched from afar. When we were together, there was nothing rough about us.


They never dared to attack us. Our momentum was high, but they knew that we were headed to the residence of the evil lord, so they didn’t bother to fight. Their greed was now directed toward something bigger.


We started walking again. At the end of the road was a manor where the evil song maker lived.


The signboard at the main gate read, “Even evildoers help each other.” It meant that even evildoers help each other to accomplish evil.


“They must have seen us coming, so they’ll be prepared and waiting.”


At my words, the evil Soma destroyed the signboard with a lightning bolt. The entire place where the signboard was attached was blown away and disappeared without a trace.


At the same time, another Amazon released its tension at the same time. The main gate and the front wall collapsed and turned to dust.


“If you came alone, it would be different, but there were four of you… … .”


The evil Soma walked ahead and added:


“If we are prepared, we should step down from the Amazon position, right?”
