# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 180 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Jeong Yeon-shin xuất hiện trước đám đông của Minh Hội (Maenghoe) với lá cờ trắng tinh khôi, tuyên bố sẽ một mình đối đầu với toàn bộ Minh Hội, một hành động khiêu khích đầy táo bạo. Cậu nhắc đến việc đội quân của Sim Mu-ryeon đã rút lui an toàn, khẳng định lời hứa về việc vinh danh Cuộc Chiến Khai Phái (Gaepa War) của mình là thật.

Heon Won-chang, thuộc hạ của Jeong Yeon-shin, ca ngợi chủ nhân mình và khẳng định những lời cậu nói là sự thật, biến đây thành một lời tuyên chiến công khai. Hành động này gây kinh ngạc cho đám đông, chia sự chú ý của họ giữa Jeong Yeon-shin, các lãnh đạo Minh Hội, và Zhuge Qian, người đại diện cho Minh Hội.

Zhuge Qian rơi vào thế khó, không thể chấp nhận lời đề nghị của Jeong Yeon-shin một cách dễ dàng, nhưng cũng không thể từ chối vì sợ làm tổn hại danh tiếng của Minh Hội. Seop Woon-cheol, một cao thủ trung cấp, lên tiếng chế nhạo, cho rằng Jeong Yeon-shin chỉ giỏi hùng biện. Đáp lại, Jeong Yeon-shin yêu cầu giao đấu ngay lập tức.

Sự xuất hiện của Jeong Yeon-shin với vẻ ngoài thanh lịch và khí chất cao ngạo thu hút sự chú ý của nhiều người. Trong khi Zhuge Qian còn đang lo lắng về thực lực của cậu, Seop Woon-cheol đã quyết định giao đấu để bảo vệ danh tiếng của mình. Sojun, người lẽ ra là đối thủ của Seop Woon-cheol, cố gắng ngăn cản, cảnh báo Jeong Yeon-shin về số lượng cao thủ tham gia Cuộc Chiến Khai Phái (Gaepa War).

Jeong Yeon-shin đáp trả bằng cách tuyên bố sẽ tiếp đón tất cả những ai muốn thách đấu mình dưới lá cờ của Iphwangseong (Đế Hoàng Thành) trong suốt thời gian diễn ra Cuộc Chiến Khai Phái (Gaepa War). Cậu tháo kiếm và đặt tay ra sau lưng, ra hiệu cho thấy sự tự tin tuyệt đối. Seop Woon-cheol không thể chịu đựng thêm sự khiêu khích này và lập tức tấn công.

Seop Woon-cheol tung ra kiếm pháp sắc bén, nhưng Jeong Yeon-shin dễ dàng né tránh và phản công. Chỉ trong một khoảnh khắc, tóc của Seop Woon-cheol bị cắt và kiếm của Jeong Yeon-shin đã kề ngay trán ông ta. Jeong Yeon-shin hạ kiếm và hỏi Sojun: "Ngươi nói là bốn mươi." Cậu tra kiếm vào vỏ, tuyên bố rằng bốn mươi đối thủ như Seop Woon-cheol cũng chỉ là một phép tính cộng đơn giản.

It’s a scary and fearsome show.


He spoke of the martial arts alliance’s secret martial arts. It meant that he would handle the alliance alone.


Jeong Yeon-shin smiled deliberately. She had accepted Heon Won-chang’s advice.


He said it would be a provocation that would be difficult to avoid even with a small smile.


It was a completely incomprehensible statement, but the way the great general Iphwang lived had proven its usefulness on several occasions.


They’ve intervened to change the structure of a huge event. It’s hard to believe that their intentions will be easily achieved.


Heonwonchang said that we have to keep pushing with words.


“… … .”


An eerie silence fell.


A boy looking down at the men of the Maenghoe, a fluttering flag that reflects off all the pouring sunlight.




It was as if he had revealed the stronghold of Iphwangseong in the Murim Alliance’s opening battle. He said it was after he had gone on a campaign as the leader of the Magwangikju.


“Is that nobleman the Magwangikju?”


“You kicked out Sim Mu-ryeon… …?”


There were people who spoke cautiously. They seemed to be relatively unconnected to the world of martial arts.


The temples were either concave or flat, and the appearance was like that of a horse’s clothing instead of a martial arts uniform.


If what the young hero who first threw the flag said is true.


If Sim Mu-ryeon’s martial arts army really retreated.


This is no ordinary event for the common people living in the Korean-Chinese land.


Many people stopped going up because they didn’t even trust the military power of the flag. They were experiencing problems directly related to their livelihood.


“There have been many people who have entered the castle safely recently.”




“The master of the Imperial Palace has bestowed grace… …!”


“Go check it out! Right now!”


A thick cloud of dust rose from one corner. There was a lot of activity everywhere.


Commoners and monks who had difficulty exchanging news with the outside world, small merchants who were indirectly affected by the logistics traveling between Korea and China, and even major merchants and prominent figures.


Different expressions spread across everyone’s faces.


There was a mixture of confusion and admiration.


There were also those who ran back without looking back. The influence of Sima Wei and Thirteen Thousand was like that.


It is a huge breakwater that most martial arts schools do not even protest against.


Seomye Jeongyeonsin was given the nickname of Hwajungamwang because of her work in Sacheonseong 13th Heaven.


The defeat of the Great Patriotic War is a major event anywhere.




“… … .”


The men of the Menghui remained silent. They sat or stood in a daze, watching the small mockery of the young Ma Gwang-ik-ju.


That was when.


From one corner of the audience, a young man named Youngwoong Geon spoke with clear pronunciation.


“The great lord of Iphwangseong does not lie. He does not engage in any business through trickery. He walks the upright path of martial arts in reverence to the great lord of Iphwangseong and silently practices chivalry. The deeds of Ma Gwang-ikju discussed today are true. His promise to honor the Gaepa War alone is also the same. Nothing will be in vain.”


He speaks highly of my lord with the air of a hero.


It’s a declaration of war. The unmanned Iphwangseong has started a fight.


The flag of another faction was planted in the confederation of political parties, and the appearance and the series of events were refreshing rather than vulgar. It was a very clear provocation.


Some in the audience were amazed.


“Your words are like a flowing river. Isn’t your tongue like a sword?”


“He is a young man that anyone from Seoju would know. Heonwonchang, the great warrior of Iphwang. He is a warrior who protected the people from demons. I didn’t know I would see him here again… … He is a subordinate of Magwangikju.”


It is a place where a newly created wave invites the crowd and announces its intentions through martial arts.


It becomes a meaningful event only when the swords of the powerful people who are bound by silver are met. That is why it is called the Opening of a Faction Battle.


The justification put forward by Heonwonchang was overwhelming.


It is worthy of the significance of the Gaepa War. It is not something that can be ended with an intrusion.


“How generous. No, how bold.”


“The Murim Alliance and the Iphwangseong’s Bimurani… … .”


The crowd’s gaze was largely divided into three groups: the young Ma Guang-ik-ju, the audience seats of the Menghui leaders, and Zhuge Qian, who had not yet left the stage.


There was a silent encouragement in people’s eyes. It meant that it was right to accept it.


Even though I couldn’t say it out loud, the pressure was palpable.




“… … .”


The military commander in chief, the geomancer Zhuge Qian, kept his mouth shut tightly. If he opened his mouth hastily, he might show his embarrassment.


It was not to be. The invited guest, but the uninvited guest, Ma Gwang-ik-ju, was in front of me.


As someone who represents the face of the Murim Alliance, this is something that cannot be looked down upon.


‘This is a dilemma.’


It is a serious matter. It cannot be accepted rashly. However, refusing the offer of Ma Gwang-ik would be a great blow to the reputation of the Menghui.


Jegal Hyun glanced at the canopy where the leader was seated. He needed the head of the household to respond. It was not a matter for the military commander to decide.


at that time.


The silent Hwiseongeom Seopuncheol opened his mouth. He was a mid-level master who had come forward to begin the fourth day of the Gaepa War with Yeoju Ilhyeop.


Beneath her gentle eyebrows, her delicate eyes sparkle with awe.


“It seems that the first virtue of the Emperor has changed. Has the three-inch tongue become the main quality instead of martial arts and chivalry?”


“Isn’t it your faction that mainly enjoys debate?”


The boy wearing black robe answered.


It’s next to the pure white Jangpo flag.


He is carrying a backpack and receiving hundreds of pairs of gazes. His entire body is adorned with the divine law.

From his pitch-black leather shoes to his full-body robe, not a speck of dust could be seen.


It was the appearance of the leader of the Ip Hwang Seong Forces that was blown away by the wind that he had created himself.


The young master didn’t even glance at him. He opened his lips without even looking at the Hwiseon Sword and Yeoju Ilhyeop on either side.


“Stop talking nonsense and take up arms.”


It’s an attitude that is hard to come by in the Baekdo Jeongpa. Some of the audience held their breath.


Only the hem of the pitch-black robe that covered the boy’s entire body swayed peacefully.


An incredibly arrogant speech and behavior, with a noble appearance.


Saaaaa―


A gentle breeze blew. It passed by transparently, sweeping across the collar of the Emperor’s robe. It was a particularly elegant breeze.


It was a rare place with no entertainment. It was common for people to walk a hundred miles to see the beautiful scenery.


An outstanding appearance shines even more in places like this.


If he was an exceptionally handsome swordsman, even if his conduct was somewhat arrogant, he would be an object of favor. He was a very rare sight.


There were many people gossiping.


“How refreshing… … .”


“Are all the high-ranking warriors of Iphwangseong like that? They seem like people from the Peach Blossom Land.”


“Do you know what ‘throwing a fruitful cart’ means? … I would have thrown one too.”


The story of Chuck and Younggeo is a tale that has been passed down for hundreds of years.


There was an anecdote from the Three Kingdoms period that those who were captivated by the beautiful appearance of Ban-ak filled his carriage with fruit.


Noblemen like Gongsun Min and ladies from prestigious families showed their affection for Meng Hui without paying attention to his feelings.


Ma Gwang-ik-ju has been leading public opinion with his achievements, appearance, and just cause.




Rejection is the worst shame.


‘This is a big deal… …! What is the level of the martial arts of the Magwangikju? More than half of the Simmuryeon martial arts forces returned safely to the Yeongcheon Sword Demon. There must be some experts who can argue with the odds of victory, but they are only a few years old… … We cannot let the renowned warriors of the Alliance struggle.’


While Zhuge Qian, who was becoming anxious, was exchanging messages with the leader’s observation barracks.


The expression disappeared from Hwiseongeom Seopuncheol’s face.


He was born into a prestigious family that had been renowned for martial arts in Korea and China for generations.


Today’s Gaepa Battle was the day of the Ye family of Hanjung, who had been promised by Zhuge Liang. They wanted to show off their martial arts to the world.


He had the head of the most powerful clan in Korea and China as his older brother-in-law. His wife’s brother was the Zhuge Liang family head.


The match was decided. The turn of Ungajeilkwon and Hwasangeomjeol was pushed back to the next day.


Seop Woon-cheol was a master of a local family and was hungry for fame. Most martial artists live off their honor through martial arts.


The opening of the Murim Alliance was an opportunity. So many outsiders flocked to the area.


He waited for the moment to rest his body and mind in the admiration of his fellow martial artists and the people.


It’s not a situation where you can be bothered by a lover.


This seat.


I couldn’t back down anyway. If I wanted to save face, I had to fight even if I lost.


The bastards of Ip Hwang Seong made it like that. They were truly the ones who planned it. A cold light flashed across Seop Woon Cheol’s eyes.


“Let’s give it a try.”


He said.


The pride of mid-level experts often overrides the difference in reputation, even today.


The achievements accumulated over a long period of time do not stop at mere ignorance, but become life itself. It is the pride of a master, the traces of his life.


It was the same even if the opponent was a master of the black-and-yellow color.




There is no middle-aged martial artist who would deny his own life without even comparing it directly.


“Come.”


The young Magwangikju said.


Seop Woon-cheol didn’t answer. He silently raised his left hand and held the sword.


“Just wait a minute!”


The middle-aged man across from Seop-un-cheol stomped his feet once. The stage shook briefly with a heavy vibration.


It was a weighty awakening. Yeoju Ilhyeop Sojun. He was originally the non-combat opponent of Hwiseongeom Seopwooncheol.


“You’re trying to change the form of the Gaepa War so hastily here? I can’t agree with this!”


“So Daehyeop, please step back for a moment. I, Seopwooncheol, will take charge of the meeting.”


“This isn’t something to be decided so hastily! It’s a big deal!”


Sojun, who shouted as if reprimanding, looked back at Jeongyeonshin.


“There are four more days left until the opening of the main battle. As far as I know, there are more than forty people who will display their martial arts skills during the four days. They are masters who are well-known throughout the world. Each one is a hundred times stronger than the other. They all have outstanding skills.”


“… … .”


“Even if we take the lowest and fight twenty times, it’s six hundred times. Six hundred breaths in the ascending realm. You’d better think carefully about it. No matter how deep your inner energy is, it’s something that no one can learn without suffocating. Even if you go back on your words, no one will dare blame you.”


Yeoju Ilhyeop Sojun spoke calmly. His thin lips trembled slightly, unlike his tone.


The unexpected appearance of the Magic Wand is bound to steal everyone’s attention.


This is not right. It is right to wake them up to reality and send them down from the stage.


‘I’ve been on a roll for a while, but then I fell down… … .’


If the beginning were now, I would just be swept away by Magwangikju.


The eyes of many warriors and warlords, including Zhuge Cheon and Xiao Jun, who had stopped on the other side, were focused on Jeong Yeon-sin.




“I give you this.”


The boy opened his mouth, touching the sword.


“It is one of the seventeen walls of Iphwangseong. It is the fortress that you must overcome if you wish to go against the true nature.”


“… … .”


“As the envoy of the Emperor, I will treat you well. Tomorrow, the day after, and until the end of the Gaepa War, I will share my hands under this flag. You may use this great phoenix as your touchstone. Think of it as broadening your horizons with the martial arts of the Magwangikju, how sharp and how strong it is. This body is the gift of Gaepa to the Emperor.”


Soon, he took his hands off the flag and sword and slowly put his hands behind his back. His jet-black hair was fluttering along with his black robe.


It was madness. It was a call to war.


thud!


Seop-un-cheol, who couldn’t stand to hear this, took a sharp look. There is no one who can tolerate such provocation.


Magwangikju definitely challenged the entire Murim Alliance to a fight. He came in under the pretext of being formal and opened up a gap in the Gaepada War.


Now it had to be considered as a full participation.


“Are you as strong as your black three-inch tongue?”


He came in at the same time as I drew my sword. It was my left hand’s sword. Before I could even strike, a sharp wave of light came out.


The dust that had risen from beneath Seopuncheol’s feet was torn to shreds.


It’s finally starting.


The crowd held their breath. The structure of the Gaepa War changed in an instant. It was a fight between the Murim Alliance and Iphwangseong.


How far can such a young Ma Gwang-ik-ju handle it? Hwi-seon-geom was the greatest swordsman in Korea and China.


Even if you win with difficulty, what will happen after that?


‘Left hand sword.’


Jeongyeonshin turned around. She was faced with Seopwooncheol, who was sprinting forward with his sword.




Hwiseon Sword. The nickname has the character Hwi, which means shining. It seems to be a phrase praising swordsmanship, and the posture is straight.


It was the union of the divine swords. The wind that swept through the entire area from the swordsmanship. It felt like the momentum was enough to pierce my skin.


Even though the world is vast, there are not many instances where you will encounter a left-handed swordsman. Left-handed swordsmen usually take advantage of this.


He used to practice flashy swordsmanship. Seobuncheol also seemed to be that kind of swordsman.


Even though the sword tip was constantly shaking, he was able to gain strength.


‘I understand. It’s a Korean-Chinese poem. It’s worth including in the Baek Baek Chongram.’


The boy, who had been staring blankly at him, grabbed the sword armor below his waist with his left hand.


He wrapped his sword with his right hand. The energy rising from his heart was absorbed into his heart.


The magic wheel gently swirled in my hand. It had a warm texture.


“Ugh!”


It was Seopwooncheol’s inhalation. He bent his upper body five steps in front. His sword aimed at Jeongyeonshin’s side.


The energy exploded from the Yongcheon point on the sole of his foot, which was extended backwards after hitting the ground.


The stage shook violently, sending shards of rock flying in all directions.


BAM! WHAAAAH!


Amid the loud noise, the boy also drew his sword.


The blade of the divine sword Bukmyeong rose brilliantly. It seemed as if the sunlight was chasing after it and wrapping around the sword body.


A ray of light streamed from the blade. It was only for a moment. The Bukmyeong sword held by Jeongyeonshin soon disappeared into thin air.


Woof!


A faint beam of light rippled. A feathery cloud-like light was engraved in front of the boy who stretched out his hand.


He accurately avoided the sword strike of the rushing Seopuncheol and shattered the light waves from the blade into pieces.


It was an incredible feat. The swordsmanship of the Magwangikju continued to run like a whirlwind.


“… … !”


The moment Seop Woon-cheol, with his eyes wide open, hurriedly laid back, his glossy hair was cut off on both sides of his neck.


A fierce, bitter wind blew across the back of my neck and flew up.


Kuuuung!


A thunderous noise erupted from the air. It was the aftereffect of the sword strike.


It was a single sword that filled the surrounding silence with shock.


Before I knew it.


The boy stood with the Bukmyeong sword pointed forward.


He is holding the backpack behind his back with his left hand, and the tip of the pure white sword is touching Seop Woon-cheol’s forehead.


It looked like he was teaching a lesson to a lower class.


Jeong Yeon-shin glanced at Yeo Ju-il and So-jun, who were standing on one side, and calmly opened her lips.


“You said forty.”


He didn’t lower his voice. The veins on the boy’s arms, with his sleeves rolled up, were long.


Jeongyeonshin lowered the sword she was aiming and swung it briefly.


A white light dimmed along the sword’s blade. It was the residual light wave of the sword strike.


The boy moved the Bukmyeong sword.


The blade returns, drawing a graceful trajectory.


The sword, which was shedding silver light, was put back into its scabbard. A small sound rang out unusually clearly.


widely.


“Forty sums will do.”


The young Ma Gwang-ik-ju was shocked.
