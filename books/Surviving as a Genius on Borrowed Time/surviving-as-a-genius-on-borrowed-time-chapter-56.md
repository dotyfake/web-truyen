# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 56 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Jeong Yeon-shin đến một khu vườn, nơi Ji-hyeon của gia tộc Hwangbo đang tiệc tùng xa hoa với các chiến binh và kỹ nữ. Jeongyeonshin yêu cầu Ji-hyeon triệu tập người vợ cả của hắn, nhưng Ji-hyeon chế nhạo cậu vì thiếu hiểu biết về thế giới võ lâm và luật lệ triều đình. Người vợ cả của Ji-hyeon, Hwangbo Mi-mi (Deep Trench Sword), xuất hiện và chế giễu Jeongyeonshin vì dám nhắc đến người thân của ả.

Jeongyeonshin chỉ trích Ji-hyeon vì lợi dụng dân thường và ảnh hưởng đến cuộc sống của họ bằng quyền lực võ lâm. Điều này gây ra một tràng cười nhạo báng từ Ji-hyeon, Hwangbo Mi-mi và đám chiến binh. Ji-hyeon còn ra lệnh cho một đoàn nhạc trỗi lên và các chiến binh tấn công Jeongyeonshin. Cậu nhớ lại những câu chuyện về thú vui bệnh hoạn của giới thượng lưu, khi họ thích xem cảnh giết người.

Jeongyeonshin tự nhủ rằng nơi này khác biệt hoàn toàn so với sự yên bình cậu từng cảm nhận. Cậu quyết định hành động, sử dụng Wolyeongjohwagyeol (Wolyeongjohwagyeol) và Jeolse Shingong (Jeolse Shingong) để tạo ra một luồng gió mạnh, hạ gục hai tên địch chỉ trong nháy mắt. Cậu tiếp tục tấn công, chém giết thêm một tên nữa, và tuyên bố sẽ trừng phạt chúng nhân danh Hoàng đế.

Ji-hyeon hoảng sợ và ra lệnh dừng lại, cố gắng biện minh cho hành động của mình và cầu xin sự tha thứ. Hắn đổ lỗi cho gia tộc Hwangbo và đe dọa Jeongyeonshin. Baek Mi-ryeo và Cheong-myeong tiến lên phía trước. Ji-hyeon ra hiệu, và thêm ba mươi chiến binh nữa xuất hiện. Hắn tự tin rằng với lực lượng này, họ có thể đối phó với Jeongyeonshin.

Jeongyeonshin nhận xét về sự "thanh lịch" của bọn chúng, rồi kích hoạt Bukmyeonggeom (Bukmyeonggeom), tạo ra một âm thanh chói tai và những đợt sóng năng lượng vô hình. Hàng chục người ngã xuống, và chỉ còn lại Ji-hyeon, Hwangbo Mi-mi và một vài tên sống sót. Jeongyeonshin nhận xét rằng đám người này "biết cách vui chơi" và cất kiếm, cho thấy sức mạnh áp đảo của mình.

The Iphwangseong Mubok has rough yellow threads on both shoulders and the center of the back.


Those looking straight at it were hard to recognize it, unless they had some level of insight.


“Is this Ji-hyeon from Pyeong-eum-hyeon?”


Jeongyeonshin asked quietly.


They said it was an old operation. I’ve heard a lot about it.


Ip Hwang-seong found out everything he could and dispatched the armed forces under the Shingeomdan.


The main family of the Hwangbo family, as well as the members and martial arts characteristics of its branch families, were also subjects of collection.


“Can’t you tell just by looking at it? It’s a body that’s quite well-known.”


The noble man answered with a smile.


He was a handsome man with such an impressive appearance that his official attire made him look noble.




While looking at the unfamiliar warriors, he was being served drinks by the women, and the hand holding the glass was so dignified that it felt like it was his own.


Even though he was just a ruffian wearing a crown, his character seemed to have a different class.


The gaze of Myeongjok Jihyun, who had passed by Jeongyeonshin and Baek Miryeo, fell on Cheongmyeong.


“You’re from the same clan. Are you enjoying playing swordsmanship together? I’d advise against it. I’ll give you some advice in advance.”


“······.”


Cheongmyeong didn’t answer with a strange expression on his face.


The atmosphere in the garden was strange.


The smell of alcohol filled the air, and everyone walking around looked at Jihyun with reverent expressions.


Some people sent similar gazes to Cheongmyeong.


‘There are many Han Chinese people who admire the famous family all over the world.’




Jeong Yeon-shin thought. Is that what debauchery is? It was an atmosphere that she had never experienced before, even in Jeonggajang.


He opened his mouth as he slowly stepped forward.


“I know that the head of the Pyeongumhyeon Hwangbo branch is your first wife. Bring her in.”


“You have no manners. Have you never been exposed to Confucianism? Did your parents teach you that?”


Myeongjok Jihyun answered with a leisurely smile.


“A man named Ji-Hyeon colluded with the Murim family. What kind of respect can he expect when he is not behaving like a gentleman?”


At Jeong Yeon-shin’s calm answer, the woman who had been massaging Ji-hyeon’s arm stood up. She seemed to be around thirty.


The languidly downcast eyes were impressive, and they gradually revealed aura that suited the red uniform they were wearing.


“The real wife is said to be Geumrang’s wife. If you are a Shandong military man, you must have heard of it. The real wife is Hwangbo Mi-mi, the Deep Trench Sword.”


The story is that Ji-hyeon’s surname is Geum. Lang (郎) is a word used to refer to her husband.




With the founding of the Ming Dynasty, the Ming clan rose to power.


Women often held important positions in government offices from the bottom up and in the various martial arts schools.


He said it was completely different from the Yuan Dynasty.


It didn’t matter at the moment.


“As the head of the Pyeong-eum Hwangbo family, I command you to refrain from rude words and actions. No. It is already useless. What could have been done with one arm has now turned into a neck.”


As the woman’s energy grew stronger, the warriors in the various pavilions came out.


There are more than twenty of them. They may look down on him in words, but they do not look down on the martial arts that broke down the gate.


It could be said to be a branch of a prestigious family.


Five of the warriors of the Pyeongum Hwangbo family began to approach first.


Even though they appeared unexpectedly, I felt that their prayers were firm. They had the feel of polished iron.


Even though it was a branch family, it seemed to be saying that it was a place where the eight great families had their roots.


Jeongyeonshin didn’t look at them. She stared blankly at Simsoogeom and slowly opened her mouth.


“Do you know Hwangbo Myeongrin?”


“what?”


“The words and actions used to discuss arms and necks are the same.”


“I guess I’ve heard that somewhere. He’s an outstanding kid who deserves to go to the Yongbong branch. But.”


A red smile appeared on Sim Soo-geom Hwang Bo-mimi’s lips. It seemed as if she had applied lotion. She continued.


“Did you think I would let it slide if you spoke as if you knew my direct blood relatives? That’s ridiculous.”


‘It’s the end of the world. Only people will practice cultivation.’


Jeong Yeon-shin absentmindedly thought about what the elders of the various sects would say.




In addition, the image of the queen naturally came to mind, and she had reached the absolute realm, so she was beautiful with dignity alone even without any makeup.


If you are unmanned, your martial arts skills must be exquisite to be beautiful.


He opened his lips again.


“I came back from seeing the market. It’s true that he mobilized the people for private labor. He used his power in the martial arts world to affect the people’s livelihood. As a person of martial arts, isn’t that shameful?”


Meanwhile, Cheongmyeong and Baekmirye stood back.


He said he would help the youngest in blue expand his knowledge of martial arts.


We had previously discussed that we would not intervene unless the situation was extremely dangerous, but I couldn’t figure out how to repay the kindness of my seniors, Ma Gwang-ik.


That was when everyone in Jangwon burst into laughter after hearing Jeong Yeon-shin’s words.


Jihyun and Shim Soo-geom laughed loudly without even covering their mouths.


“Child. You’ve heard a lot of bad stories about the world of martial arts. Power is just power. Do you distinguish between martial arts and the people’s livelihood? How can a person do that?”


Shim Soo-geom spoke with a smile on his face. Myeongjok Ji-hyeon also chimed in.


“The Murim family is a powerful family. How can it be wrong for them to enjoy luxury befitting their history in the place they have established?”


“You, the noble one, are denying the imperial laws. Your first wife’s head will be cut off today.”


Jeong Yeon-shin’s answer only caused ridicule once again.


This time, even the warriors who had been walking slowly burst into laughter.

“You don’t know the value of elegance. That’s what happens to those who call themselves knights. Listen.”


Jihyun clapped her hands lightly.


“Yes, Jihyun!”


From all over, people who looked like musicians came out and took their places.


He was carrying instruments that were plucked and blown with the mouth, including gold and jade.


It was a sight like watching a Peking opera.


The performance began at Jihyun’s gesture.


At the same time, the warriors of the Hwangbo clan drew their swords and approached. It seemed as if they were even entertaining the warriors’ swordplay.


‘That’s amazing.’


Jeongyeonshin stood still.


I thought of the stories I could come across at Iphwangseong, where all the things in the world gather.


It was an anecdote about some high-ranking officials who had experienced many pleasures. It was said that the ultimate pleasure they enjoyed was watching murder.


The sight I saw now was like that.


I could tell right away. This wasn’t something that could happen in a day or two.


“A young swordsman who can break down the gate of the manor. What a disappointing achievement.”


“Wouldn’t that be interesting?”


Sim Soo-geom, who had sat down again, shared a laugh with Ji-hyeon. They even shared a drink.


‘It can be this different.’


Jeongyeonshin recalled when she entered the village.


I liked the simple sound of the grass rustling that greeted the group. This place was different. It took my breath away.




“I can’t listen.”


I muttered to myself without realizing it.


The melody that began to flow through the garden was as elegant as Ji-hyeon had said.


Even Jeong Yeon-shin, who didn’t know the rhythm, felt the same way. That’s why she didn’t approach him very happily.


Shandong Province was a vast place. The center of Shandong was said to be Jinan.


There would also be many local martial artists, and among them there would be the swordsmen they were talking about.


“Go in peace.”


One of them spoke, raising his drawn sword.


It seemed like he felt a little guilty, but before he knew it, the distance between him and Jeongyeonshin had narrowed to about ten steps.


“It looks familiar. I need to reconsider the Eight Great Powers. Aren’t they just the Sapa bastards?”


Jeong Yeon-shin spoke while holding the sword of Bukmyeonggeom.


There must have been many governors who came to see the people suffering from hardships, outraged.


It seemed like they were all killed. The music flowing naturally in my ears right now. The warriors approaching, stepping on the beat as if to match the rhythm.


I decided to take the initiative.


Boom! Bam!


I stepped forward with my slightly raised foot. A concentric wind blew in all directions.


The aerodynamics that were properly created were deeper than before.


We have been continuously practicing the Wolyeongjohwagyeol while creating new methods.


The amount of energy accumulated by the Jeolse Shingong was indeed different. Even from the beginning, I could feel a slight noticeable change.


Everyone’s expressions changed in an instant. At the same time, Jeongyeonshin’s body leaned forward.




The wind blasted past my ears and my vision expanded rapidly. Movement was instantaneous.


From the hand holding the sword, waves of true energy began to spread.


Before I knew it, I was right in front of my enemies. I circulated the energy inside my body along the curve.


The dazzling sunlight shone at the tip of Gwanghwageomryu’s sword.


Swish!


In the flash of light, two heads were blown off in an instant. They couldn’t even scream.


‘It’s not the end. There are many enemies.’


A wave of energy exploded from Jeongyeonshin’s body.


Some of the momentum that surged in all directions reached the Bukmyeong Sword and transformed into a chilling sharpness.


The aftereffects of the sword strike that was launched horizontally once again with Jin-gak scraped the floor.


The sensation of the sword cutting another man’s throat continued to his palm.


Phew!


Now, Jeong Yeon-shin’s swordsmanship had reached a level where blood would spurt out with just one breath.


He shouted through the rising dust.


“I, the Emperor of Heaven, will punish you!”


It was a rebuke filled with inner strength.


Everyone in the garden was shocked and startled. It was a situation that could be described as a panic attack.


In an instant, three corpses were created. It took only the blink of an eye.


The performance, which had been flowing with a lively melody, suddenly came to a halt.


“I’m going to sleep······! Wait, wait!”




Jihyun Myeongjok, who suddenly stood up, waved her hand.


A cold sweat that had appeared at some point was making his handsome face glisten.


“I have committed a very, very great offense! Please forget what I have said so far! I am a nobleman! How could I do something that would disrupt the order of the imperial court?”


His eyes moved quickly. He scanned Jeongyeonshin, whose posture had changed and whose rough figure was revealed below her shoulders.


My gaze also fell on Baek Mi-ryeo and Cheong-myeong, who were standing there indifferently.


A look of resignation appeared on Ji-hyeon’s face. It seemed that she had reached a certainty after seeing the famous Cheongmyeong.


“······Madam, I received orders from my family, and as a Jihyeon in Jinan, I could not go against the power of the Hwangbo family.”


“You call that talking? I guess you’re not ashamed of collecting words and actions.”


“Please show mercy. I know you can’t kill an imperial official. If the members of the branch family and I join forces, it will be difficult for you to get out safely.”


As Jihyun finished speaking, a wave of energy spread from her right hand.


It was a deep internal energy that made it immediately apparent that considerable training had been accumulated.


“Instead, you are threatening me.”


“It’s like a perfect match.”


Finally, Baek Mi-ryeo and Cheong-myeong took their steps and walked out.


“If it’s the Emperor’s will, then you must have known everything. I can’t help it, right?”


Meanwhile, Jihyun’s smile regained its composure.


He lightly tapped the shoulder of his first wife, Sim Su-geom, who was glaring at Jeong Yeon-shin with a menacing gaze.


“ma’am.”


“······yes.”


Shim Soo-geom Hwang Bo-mimi snapped her fingers.




It was a moment when a sound that seemed to be full of history spread.


Thirty more warriors poured out from all the halls.


As Jinan is a huge city, each county in charge of its own affairs also has its own military force appropriate to its role.


“······.”


The silence that had covered the court for a moment did not approach silence. It was because the momentum of the Hwangbo warriors filled the court.


“Wouldn’t it be better to step down like this?”


Ji-hyeon spoke while looking at Cheong-myeong, who was now standing next to Jeong-yeon-shin.


As if he had summoned up his internal energy, the hem of his clothes began to flutter. Persuasion was conveyed as a threat.


“You. You were talking about elegance.”


Jeong Yeon-shin said. He looked around at the warriors who were gradually forming a circle and surrounding them.


“I also have a musical scale that I have been practicing recently.”


There was a vibration that arose from the Bukmyeonggeom along with the words. It was a sound that gradually grew louder.


Jeongyeonshin used all of her body’s internal energy to her full potential and glanced at Baek Miryeo and Cheongmyeong. It was at that moment that they nodded slightly.


Wheeeeeek!


A long cry arose from the sword. In an instant, invisible waves of energy surged and swept across the entire area.


“Ugh!”


“100 million······?”


It was truly an unreal sight.


Dozens of people fell in all directions with short groans. A dull thud echoed from all directions.


The swordsmanship died down quickly, but the aftermath did not.


The entire encirclement collapsed. The warriors of the Hwangbo clan lay on the ground in various positions.


They stared blankly at the sky with their eyes wide open as they died.


Only a few people, including Jihyun and Sim Soo-geom, were standing.


“Those Sapa bastards know how to have fun.”


Jeong Yeon-shin opened her mouth after looking around briefly.


“I guess it was quite impressive.”


He said as he put away the Bukmyeong sword.
