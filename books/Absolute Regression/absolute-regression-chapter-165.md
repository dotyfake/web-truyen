# Absolute Regression Chapter 165 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Jin Ha-ryeong chiến thắng trong trận đấu, nhưng không thấy Geomyeon đến chúc mừng khiến cô hơi thất vọng. Sau trận đấu, Jo-shin đến chúc mừng cô, và cô đáp lại một cách thoải mái vì đã biết chắc chắn sẽ không có hôn ước chính trị. Cô nghĩ rằng sau giải Tiểu Long Chiến (Little Dragon War), cô sẽ gia nhập tổ chức ưu tú của Liên Minh Võ Lâm (Murim Alliance).

Trong khi đó, Geommugeuk đang đưa Seodae-ryong đến một nơi bí mật. Anh ta dùng khinh công phi thường, vừa chạy nhanh vừa bảo vệ Seodae-ryong khỏi chấn động. Cuối cùng, họ đến một ngôi làng xa xôi, nơi Seodae-ryong gọi là "thiên đường". Geommugeuk nói với một đứa trẻ ở cổng làng rằng anh ta đến từ "tân giáo" (new religion) và muốn gặp chủ nhân của nơi này vì việc riêng.

Seodae-ryong ngạc nhiên khi biết Geommugeuk là người của ma giáo. Cậu hỏi Geommugeuk nơi này là đâu. Geommugeuk đáp đây là "cổng vào thiên đường". Sau đó, họ được dẫn đến một trang viên lớn có tên "Thiên Đường" (Paradise), nhưng dùng chữ "thiên đường" (paradise) mang ý nghĩa tái sinh.

Một bà lão xuất hiện, hỏi Geommugeuk về bằng chứng của "tân giáo". Geommugeuk phóng xuất chân khí ma giáo. Bà lão không hề sợ hãi. Geommugeuk yêu cầu bà lão giúp Seodae-ryong chiến thắng Tiểu Long Chiến. Bà lão đồng ý sau khi kiểm tra cánh tay bị thương của Seodae-ryong, nhưng nói rằng cậu khó có thể thắng Jin Ha-ryeong. Geommugeuk đưa cho bà lão 500.000 lạng bạc (nyang), khiến Seodae-ryong sốc vì nghĩ anh ta sẽ giữ lại một phần.

Seodae-ryong phản đối việc lãng phí tiền vào mình, nhưng Geommugeuk khăng khăng muốn cậu tập trung vào việc cứu viện môn phái khi cần thiết. Bà lão giật lấy ngân phiếu và nói sẽ bắt đầu điều trị ngay. Geommugeuk tiết lộ bà lão là Trùng Y (Insect Doctor), một danh y huyền thoại có khả năng chữa trị mọi bệnh tật bằng côn trùng.

Seodae-ryong miễn cưỡng uống thuốc và bôi cao kỳ lạ, sau đó được đặt nằm trên giường đá nóng. Trong lúc điều trị, Geommugeuk nói chuyện với Trùng Y về những con côn trùng độc hại mà bà nuôi. Trùng Y hỏi Geommugeuk tại sao lại hào phóng trả tiền khi biết rõ về bà.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-164/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-166/)Episode 165: Is This Paradise?




Jin Ha-ryeong’s sword caused changes in succession.


The opponent who was unable to stop her dazzling swordsmanship eventually admitted defeat.


“I lost.”


Jin Ha-ryeong raised his hand to everyone as the sword pointed at his neck was withdrawn.


A thunderous roar erupted.


“Jinharyeong is the best!”


“Awesome, Jin Ha-ryeong!”


“The winner is Jin Ha-ryeong!”


“Hubei Ilmi Jinharyeong!”


But today, the words she had been waiting for were not heard. She looked around at the warlords, but Geomyeon was nowhere to be seen.




‘Are you badly hurt?’


I heard that the master that Geomyeon served was injured in the Palgangjeon. I knew that was probably why he couldn’t come, but I still felt a bit disappointed. I wish he had come for a moment, even if it was while I was away.


‘I can’t do that when the master is sick.’


As she came down from the stage with such regret, an unexpected person was waiting for her.


“Congratulations on your victory.”


He was careful. Normally, he would have made a firm impression, but today, for some reason, he treated him gently.


“thank you.”


“If Miss Jin wins, I will hold a separate celebration party.”


“Thank you for your kind words. Then I have to prepare for the next match.”


Jin Ha-ryeong left unarmed after lightly shaking the weapon.




Jo-shin felt that for some reason she was treating him more gently than usual.


‘Was he right?’


He said he knew a lot about women, but he changed the way he treated them with just one congratulation.


‘This kid is actually more useful than he looks.’


But that was his mistake.


The reason Jin Ha-ryeong was comfortable was because he had received a definite answer from his grandfather during their walk yesterday that there would be no political marriage.


Then, there is no need to be uncomfortable and stand in a corner with caution. After all, once the Little Dragon War is over, there will be no need to see his face. He will join the elite organization of the Murim Alliance and begin new activities.


‘Friend, I hope your majesty gets better soon.’


That way, you can hear a welcoming voice amidst the cheers.


\* \* \*




At that moment, Geommugeuk was going somewhere with the young master.


“Eww! It’s so fast!”


Geommu-geuk ran towards the sky carrying Seodae-ryong. Seodae-ryong on his back was just screaming.


It was too fast. Even if he used lightness, it was shocking that a person could run this fast. And he did it while carrying himself.


Seo Dae-ryong couldn’t even open his eyes. Even when he managed to open them, his surroundings were passing by so quickly that he felt dizzy. What on earth could he see that made him run like this? He felt like he was going to faint from the anxiety that he would crash into a tree or a rock at any moment.


What was even more surprising was that even in the midst of all this, his body was extremely comfortable. Psychologically, he was scared and anxious, but his injured body was wrapped in the energy of the sword dance, so that it would not shake even while running.


‘Is this possible? Running this fast and protecting me?’


If he hadn’t experienced it firsthand, he would never have believed it. Seo Dae-ryong had been surprised by Geommu-geuk many times, but he was even more surprised that there was still something like this to be surprised by. No, there was something else to be surprised by. He didn’t even rest while running. How much internal energy did he have?


‘Maybe it’s a dream. Am I dreaming of fainting on stage? Huh? Am I dead?’


After carrying on the back of Geommugeuk and fantasizing about all sorts of things, they finally arrived at their destination. The place they arrived at was a village far away from the Murim Alliance.


“Eww! Is this paradise?”


Seodaeryong, who had come down from the back, staggered and collapsed on the spot. He was so dizzy that he thought he was going to die. He took a deep breath.


“Ah! Now I feel like I can live. This is paradise. People should live with their feet on the ground.”


Seo Dae-ryong looked around, brushing back his messy hair. He was nervous inside. He had embarked on a journey that would not spare him from hellish training, but Geommu-geuk said he would go to paradise, and yet he had been brought to a village like this.


“Let’s take a break over there.”


There was a table at the entrance to the village, and a child was lying there reading a book.


Seo Dae-ryong felt strange. Why did he come here in such a hurry and then rest on a flat surface like this? And on a flat surface at the entrance to the village where a child was reading a book?


Then something even stranger happened. The swordsman spoke to the child lying on the bed.


“Child, go and bring me a bottle of worm-brewed wine.”


At the end of the sword dance, the child who had been lying down reading a book stood up, yawned, and asked.




“Who introduced you?”


Through this conversation, Seo Dae-ryong was able to figure out that what Geommu-geuk had said earlier was some kind of secret language.


“I came from the new religion.”


When the Sword Dance Theater revealed that he was a demonic cult, Seo Dae-ryong was shocked. This was because he had never revealed his true identity since he started this work.


On the other hand, the child was not surprised at all, as if he had no idea where the new religion was.


“Tell them that this is a private matter, not an official matter, so they can handle it as usual.”


“Yes. Please wait.”


The child disappeared somewhere. Only then did Seo Dae-ryong ask Geommu-geuk.


“Where is this place?”


“The entrance to paradise.”


“It doesn’t look like paradise at all?”


“What do you think paradise is?”


“well.”


“Did you just picture me drinking alcohol at a banquet in a room full of beauties?”


Seo Dae-ryong was startled.

“No, that’s not true.”


Seo Dae-ryong’s face turned red as he tried to deny it. Perhaps he was thinking of a more obscene paradise.


“Listen, you sentient beings! Most of the places in the world that seem like paradise are actually hell. Hehehe.”


“The great monk who has attained enlightenment, please go inside and call our master. Ah! Where is this place?”


“You’ll know when you go.”


After a while, the child returned.


“They told me to bring you here. Please follow me.”


Geommugeuk and Seodaeryong followed the child.


There was a formation set up on the winding road. If you didn’t know the exact location of the gate, you would keep wandering around and end up going somewhere else.


As we passed through the gate, there was a huge manor.


The sign posted there.


Paradise.


It was a paradise where the atom of paradise was used, not the atom of paradise. It means a wish to be reborn in paradise.


“Is this really paradise?”


“I told you I was going to heaven.”


An old woman was standing where the child had entered.


At first glance, she looked like she was praying an extraordinary prayer. Her back was straight, and she didn’t look like an old woman. However, she had bandages wrapped around her head and arms, indicating that she had been badly injured.


“You came from the new religion?”


“That’s right.”


“What is the evidence of a new religion?”




The sword dance unleashed a magical energy. It was a magical energy with enough momentum that she could trust it.


“Stop! Why are you giving off such bad vibes? Thud! Thud!”


The old woman brought salt and sprinkled it on herself. She seemed not at all afraid of the devil.


“You are very profound for your age.”


“thank you.”


“Why did you reveal your identity?”


“No matter how much I try to hide it, you’ll know anyway.”


“Do you know enough about me? Then it’s easy to talk. What do you want?”


Geommugeuk looked at Seodaeryong and said.


“Please let this guy win this Little Dragon Tournament.”


Seo Dae-ryong looked at Geommu-geuk in surprise.


“If you ask me to let you win, can you win?”


“maybe?”


“yes?”


The old woman approached Seo Dae-ryong with her eyes wide open. She limped, as if her leg was also injured.


The old woman extended her hand to Seodaeryong.


“hand!”


She had injured her right arm and held out her left arm.


“Oh, I hurt my left arm.”


“Then shall this old man stick out his sore arm?”




“No. So you mean, we have to shake hands?”


But the old woman still held out her hand. At that moment, Seo Dae-ryong reluctantly grabbed her arm.


The old woman quickly lifted Seodaeryong’s injured arm up.


“Ahhhhh!”


Despite Seo Dae-ryong’s screams, the old woman moved his arms around wildly.


“Your arms are attached well.”


“Ahhhhhhhhhhh! I’m dying!”


“What a joke!”


“I thought I was going to die from the pain!”


“You can tell just by looking at him that he has a face that makes him good at telling jokes.”


Seo Dae-ryong pouts and looks at Geommu-geuk. He asks with his expression who the hell is this damn old woman, but Geommu-geuk just smiles.


“Let me swing it around once.”


“You don’t like it?”


The old woman seemed to be approaching Seo Dae-ryong, then grabbed his arm and shook it here and there. Her movements were so fast that Seo Dae-ryong couldn’t stop them.


“You still don’t like it? Even like this?”


“Ahhhhhhh! No, I like it! Please save me! I will do it!”


It was only then that the old woman let go of my arm.


Seo Dae-ryong pulled out his sword while wiping away the tears that were streaming down his face because of the pain.


The old woman, who had been watching Seodaeryong’s diet for a while, shook her head.


“It’s hard. I can’t beat Jin Ha-ryeong at this rate.”




The old woman was well aware of the current situation in the Little Dragon War. She knew exactly how strong Jin Ha-ryeong was, the favorite to win, and she also knew how strong Seo Dae-ryong was by the way he wielded his sword.


“I came to you because things were difficult. Aren’t you the one who makes the impossible possible?”


“That depends on how much you can afford. How much can you afford?”


The price of the sword dance was not negotiated.


He gave the five hundred thousand nyang he had brought to the old woman.


“It’s five hundred thousand nyang.”


Then Seo Dae-ryong was surprised.


“Wait a minute! Are you sure you were looking for that money to use on me?”


“okay.”


“No! No!”


Seo Dae-ryong thought that Geommu-geuk would use it for himself until he found the money, but he didn’t know that he would use all of it.


“It’s my money, why can’t you?”


“Anyway, it won’t work. I’m giving up on the path I wanted to take. It was all nonsense. I’m happier the way I am. Five hundred thousand nyang?”


Seo Dae-ryong sent a telegram.


– And that old lady is weird, isn’t she? You can tell just by looking at her that she’s a mysterious quack. Who else would she cure when her own body hurts like that? Or her own body… … OMG! I just got eaten by a bug!


The old woman was sitting on a rock, rubbing her arms and legs, chewing something hard.


“Inspector Seo. You can always make money, but this opportunity will never come again.”


“I don’t like it. Don’t spend this much money on me. It’s a waste of even 50,000 nyang.”


“And it’s worth it. It’s the price a man pays to become truly unmanned.”


“For a man to become a warrior, it takes more than five hundred thousand nyang, it takes will and courage.”




“Don’t worry. From now on, just focus on your job as an investigator. Sometimes, when a situation arises where you need to save the school from a crisis, just save it. That’ll do.”


“That’s a burdensome thing to say!”


“If you think too much, life becomes difficult. Just live however your heart desires at the time. You said you wanted to win, right? I want to make you win. It’s enough if our hearts are aligned.”


At that moment, the old woman snatched the ticket from Geommugeuk’s hand as if she was trying to steal it.


“I will accept the treatment.”


“It’s not possible!”


Seo Dae-ryong approached her to snatch the voucher back from her, but then stopped short.


The old woman just stared at him, her body frozen in the chill.


“How many days are left until this prankster’s next match?”


“Seven days left.”


“Seven days. Time is tight. Let’s start right away.”


The old woman limped into the building.


The two men, Seo Dae-ryong, quickly asked.


“Who the hell is that guy? Please tell him to get better!”


“How’s your arm?”


“How is it? It hurts more. Huh?”


Seo Dae-ryong tried to move his injured arm. It was moving better than when he first arrived. It wasn’t the old woman who had been carelessly waving her arm around before.


“Huh? It hurts less?”


Then a surprising name came out of Geommugeuk’s mouth.


“That person is the insect doctor.”


Seo Dae-ryong was surprised. It was a name he had heard before.


“Did he really exist?”


“okay.”


There was a legendary rumor floating around the martial arts world. It was said that there was a god who was good at handling insects, and that his medical skills were so excellent that he could cure all kinds of diseases using insects and even bring back the dead.


There were even rumors that his skills were superior to those of the Heavenly Demon Sect’s Ma-ui or the Murim Alliance’s Shin-ui. That wasn’t confirmed, but at least one thing was certain. Since Chung-ui himself was a master who had reached the peak of his power, it could be said that he knew the body of a martial artist better than any of the three.


“But aren’t you the type of person who is so obsessed with money that you’re called a money grub?”


“No one but this person could have restored Janelle in such a short time.”


“How on earth does this guy know? Oh, that’s okay. It’s too expensive.”


“Strictly speaking, not all of that money went to you, so you don’t have to worry about it.”


“Huh? What do you mean by that?”


Just then the door to the building opened and Chung-ui shouted.


“What are you doing not coming? Time is money, money!”


Geommugeuk and Seodaeryong hurried into the building.


As he entered, Seo Dae-ryong’s expression naturally became frowning. There were bottles filled with bugs everywhere, and all sorts of bugs were stuffed on the walls. The smell was so bad that he had to hold his nose.


Seo Dae-ryong had to drink the medicine he was given, even though he didn’t know what ingredients it contained.


“What if it’s poison? No, this is definitely poison, poison!”


Seo Dae-ryong refused to drink with a pitiful face.


“Then you will die in the most luxurious way, paying the most expensive price in the world. It will be a death that will be remembered in the history of martial arts.”


Chung-ui washed off all the ointment that had been applied and applied new ointment. Although he didn’t know for sure, it was definitely an ointment extracted from all sorts of bugs.


A new bandage was wrapped over it, and the way it was wrapped was completely different from before.


Then they laid him down on a hot stone bed.


“Get some deep sleep.”


Whether it was because of the medicine or the hot bed, Seo Dae-ryong couldn’t stand the pouring water.


“Ah, this is not it… … This is not it… … Sir, we have been fooled… … .”


So, Seodaeryong fell into a trance-like sleep.


While the treatment was in progress, Geommu-geuk looked at all the bugs he was raising in the backyard. There were hundreds of containers stacked up, and they contained all kinds of strange bugs.


Chung-ui came and stood next to Geommu-geuk and spoke while looking at the bug in front of him.


“That thing may look like nothing serious, but it has a poison that can kill you in half a minute if you bite it. I’ve built up a tolerance to the poison, so I’m fine, but you’re in danger.”


Chung-ui opened the box and took out the insect, saying it was dangerous. The poisonous insect flapped its wings quickly, wanting to jump out at any moment. She held the poisonous insect in front of Geommu-geuk’s face and asked coldly.


“If you knew about me, you would have known the cost roughly, so why did you pay so generously?”
