A peerless master who is also known as Buddha in the world.


Baekyak Sae-tae is truly an object of admiration, leading one of the old schools.


The amount of energy cannot but be close to the human limit.


It means that there is no reason to burn food with force. As you get older, you should take care of your body.


‘Are you listening?’


Jeong Yeon-shin paused in the middle of a rare passionate speech.


The eldest member of the Amipa was smiling. The corners of his lips were slightly raised, reminiscent of the Buddha’s splendid smile.


A temperament that stands out even more because the originally stiff lips have loosened up a little.


Is this a rare sight?


The expressions of the monks sitting on either side of me changed. Their faces were slightly open or their eyebrows raised. It seemed as if their silent practice had been broken.




Although he was making a lot of noise while talking, he looked different from the person who sat quietly on the outside.


In the meantime, Baekyak Sidae slowly opened his mouth.


“The Lord is a master of pupils.”


A voice with a faint hint of laughter. It was very kind. Jeong Yeon-shin almost moved her lips without thinking, but she calmly moved her lips away.


“It’s not that I don’t have any knowledge.”


“It also means that the way of seeing is different. There are many pupils in this land, but most of them do not have different orbits.”


“yes?”


“The way the Lord looks at the skin of living beings is special. Just like a parent looks after his child, or a grandchild looks after his grandparents… His view is full of determination, and his determination contains thoughts. No-nap’s heart was warmed.”


With just one word, he penetrated the secret of Jeong Ga-dong’s mind.


It was truly enormous.




Jeongyeonshin’s eyes widened slightly. On the other hand, Baekyaksa’s eyes slightly turned downward, forming soft wrinkles.


“Now I understand the sacrifice you made.”


“What are you talking about?”


“I am speaking of the letter written to announce the Bimu Jejeon to the world. The group of Sima Weidao is of a nature like the hair of a monkey, so it is not easy to gather them together, but the Lord used the Bimu Jeop to strongly rebuke them, making them unable to retreat.”


Baekyak Saetdae, with his narrow shoulders slightly straightened, continued speaking softly.


“When I first saw that phrase, I was reminded of the fierceness and defiance of my youth. I was just following my heart and seeking stability for the people.”


“My maternal grandfather… …?”


“It was a shallow thought. The donor wore uncomfortable clothes to attract attention. No-nap did not understand the Buddha’s story of who would enter hell.”


“ah.”


“To be published in the world is to take on a very heavy burden. You cannot help but worry about the public’s gaze on every single word… The burden the sponsor must have endured was very great.”




“I’m embarrassed.”


Jeongyeon Shin lowered her chin slightly as she answered. Perhaps because she was in front of the monk, she nodded because something was bothering her mind.


The Baekyak situation smiled dimly.


“I will tell the disciples of the main sect. After this Bimuje, Ami will treat Magwangikju as an honored guest. Please visit the temple that will be rebuilt sometime in the future. If sarira comes out of the body of the dead Nonap, you may make an offering to the sarira tower.”


“I will go see the living monk Jangmun.”


“Judging by your expression, it seems that you have no intention of giving up the gold simunju to No-nap.”


“He is the enemy of the unmanned nature.”


“I understand. Now I just hope that No-nap’s nerves are faster than Si-ju’s. Whoever gets on the stage first will be able to face Geum-si-mun-ju.”


“My ten-mile light is different from the Amipa’s Boshin-gyeong. The principle of Jeongjungdong is weak, and the principle of Hwae (快) and changing direction is strong. So, I hope you give it up and take care of your lumbar region.”


A low laugh escaped from the mouths of Baekyak Saetdae and the Ami Seungs.


For once, Jeong Yeon-shin’s words were not provocative but sincere. It was a place where I felt at ease. Old school was old school.


“Ami is also a martial artist in the Gangho region, so it would be difficult to show her great favor to Iphwangseong… But after clearing up the misunderstanding about the host’s behavior, I can’t help but feel my heart flowing.”


Baekyak Satae looked at Ma Gwang-ik-ju with clear eyes.


The young man in front of him probably doesn’t know how many secular sects and high-ranking officials climb Mount Ami to gain worldly benefits with just a few words from the main sect.


A monk who breaks rocks. A Taoist who walks on air.


The nine great sects, known as Gupa, also had great reputations as Buddhist and Taoist temples.


Their power to move public sentiment often reached as far as the Forbidden City in Beijing.


But it was not of interest to Magwangikju.


“I’ve thought of several ways to deal with Geumsimunju.”


A place where Jeongyeonshin was talking, Baekyaksaetdae was answering while rolling her prayer beads, and occasionally a few Ami monks would join in the conversation.




The old school’s characteristically empty atmosphere has subsided.


―Ma Gwang-ik-ju’s personality is different from what I’ve heard. The years I spent reading the Lotus Sutra in the temple were in vain.


―We have been overestimating the maternal grandfather of that poet. If you want to enter the Buddha’s immeasurable dependence samadhi through your merits, you should not be swayed by prejudice… … .


―Didn’t you give me the wisdom of a peerless master through your kind heart? You should be called a Bodhisattva.


As the scent of a temple slowly faded, gentle conversation flowed.


“dole.”


“Yes, monk.”


“If both of us are alive after the Battle of Bimuje, come back to Nonap and ask about the Hwasan Covenant. It’s related to the Pact of Baehyup.”


The Baekyak situation said.


A look of doubt appeared in Jeongyeonshin’s eyes. Volcanic elixir. The words that flowed out of the demon’s mouth on the day her maternal grandfather’s blue flame burned the Blood Flame Cult Leader.


It was said to be a pact made between the old school masters and the traitors when they were young.


Jeongyeon Shin nodded slightly.


“Yes, that’s right.”


“At that time, I think it would be better to take the children out there and come back.”


Baekyak Satae glanced over Jeongyeonshin’s shoulder. His eyes were deep and mysterious. The old monk’s pitch-black eyes contained a night sky without a single star.

At that moment, Jeongyeonshin’s shadow rippled ominously.


\* \* \*


I heard a lot of stories over the past two days.


―You must be wary of the True Dragon Heavenly Lin Shinsul. It is the Golden Shimunju’s Boshinshin. The way it increases speed in an instant is no less than that of a great power. Even Nonap almost suffered a great defeat.


―If Your Majesty were to face Geumsimunju, it would be best to refrain from using the Mancheonhwawoo spell at that time. Her Bancheon Chamryongsik has a wide trajectory, but there is no room to penetrate. It is a martial art that fills the path with strong and fierce waves…


―You shouldn’t be fooled by the appearance of the famous Geumsimunju, the best in Sacheon, or the seemingly good-natured Sipmunju. The number of commoners they have demoted in Sacheon’s martial arts world is… … .


It wasn’t just the Amip monks, including Baekyak Sae Sae.


The two men, Danggaju and Jeomchang, would each visit Jeongyeonshin separately and tell her various things. The two men were not of much help.


In the meantime, Jeong Yeon-sin had to send back Xiahou Weijin and Tian Xiaosuo, who had briefly reunited at the Tang gate.


It was to gather the scattered soldiers of Cheonrimdae, Seonmokryeong, and Suncheonik.


Now the world is in chaos.


The warrior with the rough emperor tattooed on his shoulder was likely to be a target for all kinds of martial artists, but it was said that it was even worse now that there were famines.


“Ha! Those rascals know the level of their true nature. Even the Ip-Hwang-Geom is a rare treasured sword that is hard to find in the world, so they say that baseless ronin and rascals rush to it like moths without even realizing it. No matter how white your true nature is, if you use up your energy repeatedly, you will eventually die.”


“I’ll come by the day of the non-competition.”


After leaving like that, Xiahou Weijin and Tian Xiaosuo grew distant enough to become small dots, but they still glanced back every now and then.


A gesture that was filled with concern. Was it because he was concerned about the situation where he seemed to be leaving his junior in the hands of Geumsimunju? It was different from when he faced the King of Guimyeong in the formation of the Jiaolong.


After that.


Even the dinner before the military parade was held quietly.


The masters of the sect barely opened their mouths. There was not even the sound of spoons clanking.


A person who committed massacre against the northern tribes, a former teacher of the Pure Mareunju, and the one who ate the inner part of the Imoogi.




It was said that this was the first time that the three of the thirteen heavenly lords of Sacheon gathered in one place.


The Tang clan, having lost all of its successors, showed signs of worrying that they might lose their favor as well.


Cheongseong and Ami, who had been staying overnight, seemed to be spending the remaining time with Jangmunin.


The top echelons of the Sacheon Gangho were like that. It was proof of how big of a reaction this non-combat event would have.


Damn it.


After drinking a few glasses of Shaoxing wine, Jeong Yeon-sin walked out of the banquet hall alone.


As I walked slowly across the dark ground, piercing the night air where low voices resonated intermittently, I saw a boy and a girl playing in a corner.


Children of the Tang clan’s collateral line.


At first glance, it seemed like Jeongyeonshin was in the same situation. She couldn’t stand the atmosphere of the adults.


“Next, next is me.”


“I want more. Just push ten more times.”


“I did it twenty-five times… … !”


“This time it’s real.”


It looked like they were fighting over the Dano Festival swing. It was quite cute to see them whispering, getting angry, and responding.


“Wait a minute? I want to fly around in the arms of my beloved brother.”


“Sister Ryeo Ryeo jumped higher.”


The names of the Yongbong twin siblings have been revealed. Dokryong Dang Yeo-hwa and Dokbong Dang Ryeo-ryeo. Even though they are children, they are blood relatives of the Tang family.


The expressions on their faces suddenly became gloomy, as if they knew that the two people were going to die. The term “dragon formation” was also used.


From a distance.


Jeongyeonshin stood there alone until the children left.




Suddenly, my waist felt heavy.


“… … .”


After taking a quick breath of fresh air, he placed the plate of food he had brought from the banquet hall on his shadow. It was a bowl with dumplings on it.


Saaaaa―


Nothing happened. Time just passed quietly.


yet.


Dawn began to break in the distance.


It spread faintly and reached the feet. The light of dawn that had grown brighter silently caught on the rope of the Dano Festival swing.


And then gradually, it moved to Jeongyeonshin’s waist belt, then to Geompa, and for a moment, it flashed white.


He suddenly named the new sword.


Extra thunder.


The lightning that remained on the ground.


\* \* \*


A day that the rich will talk about for a long time.


This was the opinion of some of the people who made the Misan Mountain of Sacheon a mess at that moment. In some quarters, it was almost considered a fait accompli.


No qualifications were required to watch the martial arts of peerless masters.


People had no choice but to gather. Something would happen that would drastically change not only the Sacheon River Region but also the surrounding areas.


The dozens of peaks that make up Misan were crowded with people who had gathered since morning. There were countless people who had even laid out their mats at dawn.


“Get out of the way! Can’t you tell that it’s a reserved seat just by looking at it?”


“Are you talking to me?”




“I’m also an unmanned person! Do you think I look good when I wear a blindfold? Hmm? Why the tiger pattern… No way?”


“Get out of the way. I won’t draw my sword because I see the face of a ten-year-old specialist.”


“Lie down! Lie down here!”


The crowd gradually grew in number like a cloud.


The mountain paths were packed. Not only the sword-wielding warriors, but also the upper and lower ranks came in large numbers, and the number of the common people was hard to count.


In some places, even high-ranking officials wearing precious official attire were sitting on the cliffs under sunshades.


They all gathered together like an army on the battlefield, chattering like thunder. It was a truly spectacular sight, as if people from all walks of life, from all over the world, had gathered in one place.


And then it was noon.
