# Absolute Regression Chapter 173 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Jin Ha-ryeong kinh ngạc trước tốc độ di chuyển cực nhanh của Geommu-geuk (Kiếm Vũ Cực). Cậu dừng lại một lát để cô xuống nghỉ, nhưng thực chất là để không vượt mặt ông nội cô. Ha-ryeong nhận ra Geommu-geuk còn nhanh hơn cả ông mình, người mà cô luôn tin là mạnh nhất. Cô tò mò hỏi về thân phận thật sự của cậu.

Geommu-geuk đáp mình là "khói đen, người biến mất như khói khi xong việc", nhưng cuối cùng vẫn tiết lộ mình là nhị công tử của giáo chủ Thiên Ma Thần Giáo (Cheonmasingyo). Ha-ryeong sốc đến mức rút kiếm, không tin vào tai mình. Đối với người của Chính phái Võ lâm (Murim Alliance), Ma giáo là nỗi kinh hoàng từ thuở bé, biểu tượng của cái ác.

Geommu-geuk trấn an cô, nói rằng ông nội cô đã biết thân phận của cậu. Cậu giải thích thêm rằng một thế lực bí ẩn tên Thiên Mệnh Hội (Cheonmyeonghoe) đang âm mưu chiêu mộ cô trong Tiểu Long Chiến (Little Dragon War). Cậu tiết lộ thân phận với giáo chủ, và cả hai đang cùng nhau truy đuổi Thiên Mệnh Hội. Ông nội cô đích thân ra mặt vì cô, và có cả cậu, nhị công tử Ma giáo.

Geommu-geuk nói rõ rằng cậu không muốn giấu diếm cô, vì tin rằng điều đó không tạo ra khác biệt, dù cậu là người hầu hay vương tử của Thiên Ma. Ha-ryeong có chút bối rối, nhưng rồi bật cười. Cô cảm thấy một sự hào hứng kỳ lạ khi biết đối phương là người của Ma giáo. Khi Geommu-geuk hỏi về việc trở thành lãnh đạo, cô tò mò liệu bạn của cậu có phải là Thiên Ma (Cheonma) không. Cô ước cậu sẽ sống sót để cô có thể gặp lại. Ha-ryeong chủ động bắt tay cậu, cảm thấy có chút ngượng ngùng nhưng vui vẻ.

Trong khi đó, Cheol-gon bị giam trong mật thất. Hắn suy đoán rằng giáo chủ xuất hiện không phải là ngẫu nhiên, mà là đã biết trước về cuộc tấn công. Geommu-geuk xuất hiện, không còn là tên hầu hèn nhát, mà là người truy đuổi Thiên Mệnh Hội. Geommu-geuk đề nghị tha mạng nếu Cheol-gon khai ra kẻ cầm đầu Thiên Mệnh Hội, nhưng hắn im lặng. Geommu-geuk đoán rằng Cheol-gon cũng không biết thủ lĩnh là ai. Cheol-gon đòi đấu một trận sòng phẳng sau khi giải khai ma huyết, nhưng Geommu-geuk lập tức giết chết hắn.

Geommu-geuk nói với Jin Pae-cheon (Tấn Bài Thiên) rằng không nên cho kẻ địch bất kỳ cơ hội nào. Sau đó, cậu lên kế hoạch bắt giữ Jo-shin (Triệu Thần). Geommu-geuk đoán rằng Jo-shin sẽ tự tìm đến cậu.

Quả nhiên, Jo-shin tìm đến Geommu-geuk và trách móc cậu. Geommu-geuk vờ không biết, rồi bắt giữ Jo-shin. Trong mật thất, Jo-shin sợ hãi hỏi Geommu-geuk là ai. Geommu-geuk đáp rằng thân phận của cậu không quan trọng, mà quan trọng là tình thế hiện tại của Jo-shin. Cậu tiết lộ rằng Cheol-gon đã khai hết mọi chuyện, bao gồm cả việc Jo-shin ra lệnh bắt cóc Jin Ha-ryeong. Jo-shin kinh hoàng nhận ra mình đã bị gài bẫy. Geommu-geuk cho Jo-shin ngủ một giấc.

Bên ngoài, Geommu-geuk ra lệnh cho Jin Pae-cheon bắt giữ Joy Baek (Chu Diệc Bá), cha của Jo-shin. Cậu muốn Jin Pae-cheon nói với Joy Baek rằng con trai ông ta đã bị Thiên Mệnh Hội chiêu mộ và bị bắt vì tội ám sát Jin Ha-ryeong. Kế hoạch là để Joy Baek lộ diện, xem ông ta là thủ lĩnh Thiên Mệnh Hội hay chỉ là một thành viên bị lợi dụng. Geommu-geuk nói rõ rằng nếu phát hiện ra chân tướng của Thiên Mệnh Hội, cậu muốn tự mình kết liễu chúng để tránh hậu họa về sau. Jin Pae-cheon im lặng, không hứa hẹn gì. Geommu-geuk nói thêm rằng cậu sẽ "dọn dẹp" mọi thứ và biến mất trong im lặng.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-172/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-174/)173 It doesn’t matter who I am.




Jin Ha-ryeong couldn’t come to his senses.


This was the first time I had ever experienced such a fast flight. Everything around me passed by so quickly that I couldn’t make out any of the scenery.


I couldn’t open my eyes properly and it was difficult to breathe.


‘How on earth do you run without crashing?’


It was surprising and wonderful, but at the same time, I felt a strange sense of joy.


‘This guy was this good?’


A martial arts level that can display this level of lightness is unimaginable.


‘He is no ordinary servant.’


She didn’t know if this was something she would like so much, but she was glad. It felt like the uncrossable line between him and her had disappeared.


When the sword dance that had been running at such a crazy speed stopped for a moment,




“… … I’ll get off for a moment.”


Jin Ha-ryeong, who had gotten off his back, staggered and fell to the ground. He had to take several deep breaths to calm himself down.


“What, you? Did you learn to walk with light weights?”


The swordsman was looking somewhere with a smile. Her gaze naturally turned towards him. At that moment, Jin Ha-ryeong was startled.


I thought he had stopped to give me a break, but that wasn’t the case.


I saw the back of someone running far away. Surprisingly, it was the old man who had run ahead.


‘I caught up with Grandpa!’


I could tell that the reason he paused for a moment was because he didn’t want to overtake his grandfather.


‘Faster than Grandpa?’


She was so surprised that she almost screamed. She thought her grandfather was the best in the world. Some people said that Cheonma was stronger, but she believed that her grandfather could defeat Cheonma.




But this man caught up with my grandfather. My grandfather ran with the man who had attacked him on his side, and this man ran with him on his back. How could he catch up with my grandfather under similar conditions?


It was really unfortunate that I had to ask such a cliché question in this situation, but this was the only thing that came to mind.


“What is your real identity?”


Then the sword dance answered.


“Black smoke. A person who disappears like smoke when work is done.”


“Yeah, if you’re going to disappear like smoke, at least tell me the truth. Who are you really? Since you’ve revealed your skills like this, weren’t you planning on revealing your identity as well?”


The sword dance finally revealed its own prayer. It was a feeling of a different dimension from the presence it had shown so far. At that moment, an image came to her mind.


It was a clear sky. The endless sky was so wide and blue.


She reached out her hand, enchanted by its beauty.


Pongdang!




Soon I realized that it was the sky reflected in the water.


She dipped her hands into the water and slowly her body began to submerge.


I thought it was shallow, but it was deep. When I looked down, I couldn’t see the bottom. What could be in that deep sea? For a moment, the thought of being scared came to her mind, but then the image disappeared and she returned to reality.


At that moment, a word was heard.


“Geommu-geuk. He is the second son of the leader of the Cheonmasingyo cult.”


Jin Ha-ryeong was dazed for a moment.


‘What? The Heavenly Demon Church? The leader? The son?’


At first, I thought I had misheard something. But what part of that statement did I mishear? The Cheonmasingyo? The leader? The son?


“I misheard. Where is the temple?”


“Cheonma Shingyo.”


“I misheard you again. Where?”


“That place you call the Demonic Cult. The Cult of Heavenly Demons.”


Jin Ha-ryeong’s eyes grew wider and wider, as if she was waking up from a dream. Just when I thought, “Are these women’s eyes really this big?”, she drew her sword and stepped back.


Her sword was aimed at the sword dance. She spoke beyond the sharp blade.


“I can take all other jokes, but you can’t joke about the Demonic Cult!”


I could see how the later members of the Murim Alliance viewed the school. To them, the Demonic Cult was a fundamental fear that had been instilled in them since childhood, a group of evil, and the reason they learned martial arts.


But how surprised she must have been when he said that he was the son of Cheonma!


Her sword trembled as it was aimed. It was the first time in her life that she had been so surprised and scared. In comparison, the sword dance standing on the tip of the sword was so calm. It was as clear and quiet as the sky, and as deep as the sea.


A question suddenly arises at that moment.


“Grandpa, do you know your identity too?”




“I know.”


She couldn’t understand. If this man was a disciple of the Demonic Cult, how could her grandfather have let him be alone with her?


“At least you believe that I am not the one who would harm you. So put down that sword now.”


She slowly put away her sword. She had been so surprised earlier, but she calmed down when she heard that her grandfather knew.


The swordsman explained the situation to her.


“A mysterious force called Cheonmyeonghoe has appeared in the martial arts world. While chasing them, I found out that they were trying to recruit you in this Little Dragon War. After that, I revealed my identity to the leader and we are currently chasing after them together. If it weren’t for my granddaughter, the leader wouldn’t have personally stepped forward. And with the Demonic Cult’s Lee Gongja at that.”


She understood the situation right away.


“The lord wanted me to keep my identity a secret until the end. But I told him not to.”


“why?”


“Because that would be ignoring you. I believe that knowing my identity won’t make a difference. Whether you’re a servant or a prince of the Heavenly Horse. Nothing will change.”


“Why isn’t anything different? The only thing those two have in common is that they’re both men, but they’re completely different!”


“is it?”


Geommugeuk laughed, and Jin Ha-ryeong made a dumbfounded expression, but eventually laughed along.


The line of status called servant disappeared, and a new line called successor of the Demonic Cult was created. The line in front could be crossed by force, but the line behind was so high and dangerous that if it was done wrong, a great war could break out.


“If you feel bad, let it go.”

“I can’t solve it. I surprised people like this, so how can I solve it? I’ll never solve it again.”


But contrary to what she said, she wasn’t that upset. Rather, she felt a strange excitement at the fact that her opponent was a disciple of the Demonic Cult.


“Then what did Dongho mean when he told me to become the leader?”


“I mean it. Get stronger, gain more experience, and become a leader. I think you can do it.”


“Is that martial arts leader’s friend Cheonmago?”


“I wish that were true, but it’s so dangerous here. I don’t know if I’ll survive to see you.”


Somehow, it didn’t sound like a joke, so Jin Ha-ryeong hoped that he would survive and not die. With that thought in mind, she reached out her hand.


“Now that I know your true identity, let’s shake hands formally.”


The sword dance took her hand.


Jin Ha-ryeong grabbed his hand tightly and then shook it playfully, as if feeling awkward.


“I never thought the day would come when I would shake hands with the Demonic Cult’s Duke.”


“Me too. Come on, let’s go. We have to go quickly too.”


The sword dance turned its back on him.


She was carried again. It felt completely different now than it did the first time she was carried.


“I’ll have to brag to people later. I’ll tell you the story of when I was little, riding on a horse!”


\* \* \*


Cheol-gon was locked in a secret room.


Since the leader had subdued him directly, no one else could release his bloodline even if they wanted to.


Sitting alone in his room, he tried to figure out the situation.


It wasn’t an accident. The leader wouldn’t have appeared there by chance.




It wasn’t like I was escorting my granddaughter. If I was, it would have been the Dragon Guardians.


In other words, it only means that he knew about this surprise attack. The only person who knew about it was Jo Shin.


Then a person came into the place.


“you?”


Cheol-gon was surprised when he recognized his opponent. The person who came in was Geommu-geuk. He could tell just by looking at his eyes. It wasn’t the cowardly attendant who had tried to cut off his arm.


“ah!”


Cheol-gon sighed. He thought that Geommu-geuk was the leader’s subordinate. The leader himself took action to root out Cheonmyeonghoe? Then all these incomprehensible situations would fit together.


The sword dance sat in front of him.


“I know you are a member of Cheonmyeonghoe.”


Cheol-gon didn’t say anything.


“If you reveal who the leader of Cheonmyeonghoe is, I will spare your life.”


Still, Cheol-gon did not say anything. Geommu-geuk felt Cheonmyeong-hoe from the sight of him sitting silently with a faint murderous aura. They were an organization that was exactly like this, silent with a dark murderous aura.


“Yeah, even if you wanted to tell me, you probably don’t know who Cheonmyeonghoeju is.”


In any case, the usefulness of the iron club ended with showing Chosin that he was being captured by the leader.


That was the first time Cheol-gon opened his mouth.


“Let’s release the demonic blood and have a manly fight.”


The iron dagger’s eyes gleamed with murderous intent.


Swish! Phew!


The sword of Geommu-geuk, which was pulled out in an instant, pierced his heart. Even if he had released the demon blood and fought, it would have been a mere second of punishment, but Geommu-geuk did not even give him that opportunity.


It was because of the martial arts leader Jin Pae-cheon who was waiting outside.




As he opened the door and came out, Geommugeuk said.


“You must not give them any chance.”


Jin Pae-cheon stared at the sword dance without saying a word. He had no interest in Cheol-gon’s death. What was shaking Jin Pae-cheon’s heart now was this young, unstoppable successor to the Demonic Cult.


“Now, let’s arrest Jo-shin.”


“He might have been scared and hid.”


Then Geommugeuk smiled and said.


“He will come to me on his own feet.”


\* \* \*


As expected, the sword dance was as expected.


As Geommugeuk was about to enter the guest house, a man wearing a bamboo hat approached him, grabbed his arm, and led him into the alley.


“How did this happen?”


“That’s what I’m asking. He tried to cut off my arm. What happened?”


“I was supposed to appear before you cut off my arm. But the leader appeared before that. Why did the leader appear?”


“How do I know that?”


“You don’t know?”


“Of course. How could I, a mere servant, know what the leader of the martial arts world is doing? Didn’t the secret leak out while Prince Jo was handling the matter?”


It’s an unbelievable statement. Yes, that’s right. It’s strange to ask this guy about the leader.


“So? What happened?”


“The person who tried to kill me was caught by the leader, and Lady Jin and I returned.”


Jo Shin, who had been quietly watching the sword dance, spoke coldly.




“Kid, this is all your fault!”


Shhh!


He stabbed Geommugeuk in the neck with the dagger he was planning to give to Jinharyeong as a gift.


But his wrist was already caught by Geommugeuk.


“That’s right, it’s because of me.”


Knock knock!


The sword dance subdued his demonic and demonic blood in an instant.


Cho Shin’s eyes were so surprised that they could not grow any bigger.


A while later, Jo-shin was dragged into the secret room where Cheol-gon had died earlier. The body had been removed, but the smell of his blood lingered in the room.


Josin sat there with a fearful face.


He was confused. He was shocked that the attendant was more skilled than him. He was confused as to what the hell was going on.


Just then the door opened and Geommugeuk came in.


Cho Shin asked with a frightened face.


“Who are you?”


“It doesn’t matter who I am. What if I’m the servant you tried to cripple because of your petty pride? What difference does it make if I’m the Cheonmyeonghoe you secretly joined hands with? What matters is the situation you’re in now.”


Cho Shin intuitively felt that at least it wasn’t someone from Cheonmyeonghoe.


‘He’s from the leader’s side!’


Chosin made that decision.


“Everyone who attacked Jinharyeong has confessed.”


At those words, Cho-shin’s heart sank. That murderous and scary Cheol-gon confessed so easily? It hadn’t even been a few hours since he was captured?




“What on earth did you confess to?”


“You told me to kidnap Jin Ha-ryeong.”


Cho Shin shouted.


“This is what you planned!”


“When did I?”


“what?”


Cho Shin’s expression distorted.


“Do you know that attempting to harm the lord or his family is considered the most serious crime? If you are found guilty, you will be executed without any reason.”


At the word “true brother,” Jo-shin was gripped with fear. He could tell that the man in front of him had set him up for a trap.


“What do you want from me?”


The swordsman who had been staring at him stood up from his seat.


“You look tired. Go get some sleep.”


Phew.


A gust of wind overpowered his transfusion.


Jo-sin lay down and fell asleep.


Outside the secret room, Jin Pae-cheon was waiting, listening to the conversation inside.


“What’s next?”


“We need to catch the author’s father, Joy Baek. Please meet him and tell him that Jo Shin was recruited by the organization called Cheonmyeonghoe and was arrested on charges of attempting to kill Jin So-jeo under their orders.”


The sword dance was truly unstoppable.


“Then Joy Baek will move in some way. We will now know whether he is the leader of Cheonmyeonghoe or just someone who has been recruited by Cheonmyeonghoe. If he was recruited by Cheonmyeonghoe and didn’t know that his son was recruited, he might feel betrayed by Cheonmyeonghoe and hand Cheonmyeonghoe over to the leader. Of course, the leader must give him a breathing space.”


“What if he is the head of the Cheonmyeonghoe?”


“Then I think I would abandon my child.”


The martial arts leader, listening to Geommugeuk’s words, once again had this thought.


‘If the interest becomes a thousand years old, it won’t be easy for the Jeongpa Murim.’


I thought that if he had this much drive and insight at such a young age, he would never be able to handle it when he got older. At least at this moment, Geommugeuk felt like a more difficult opponent than Cheonmyeonghoeju.


Whether he knew his true feelings or not, Geommugeuk was worried about the leader of the martial arts world.


“I have a favor to ask in advance.”


“Something?”


“If you uncover the truth about the Thousand-Minded Mandate, leave the finishing touches to me. This is not because it is a test for my successor, but because of his meticulousness so far, if you let him live, he will do something even in the brain prison. It will definitely cause trouble later.”


If we dealt with it fairly and legally, we might have to lock up Cheonmyeonghoeju and his associates in a brain prison. This was advice not to do so.


As the leader of the martial arts world, it was not something he could easily answer, so Jin Pae-cheon did not say anything.


Geommugeuk added softly, with a look of understanding in his eyes.


“I will sweep it all away and disappear quietly.”
