Jeokbuk-


The ten experts stop surrounding Jeongyeonshin and stand in their place.


Twelve identical new models. Sunlight poured down silently on the white armor symbolizing the Manbyeongcheon Army and Manbyeongje.


“… … .”


What Jeong Yeon-shin held was a small axe.


The small axe that had bounced off the tension of the previous swing. There were several nicks engraved on the surface of the axe, but it still looked usable.


Was it because I received the healing spell that was cast in a hurry rather than through rational power?


Jeong Yeon-shin thought of the axe-chopping technique of the Ten Elements Master.


‘There was no law.’


A single blow that seemed to hit anything, a wall of internal energy that was built around it, a move that easily avoided the light waves.




But it blocked the flow of blood properly, even though it didn’t seem like any special tricks had been used.


‘Come to think of it… … .’


The first martial art that Jeongyeonshin encountered in Iphwangseong was Magwanggyeol.


How to use your body appropriately. He is famous for his ability to use any type of weapon, but the only means he has used to defeat his enemies so far have been the sword and the hammer.


Jeongyeonshin lowered the small bowl slightly. If she delves deeper into other things, she might be able to step into the Gongwolmu too.


at that time.


[Your swordsmanship and footwork are definitely the best.]


Twelve people surrounded Jeongyeonshin and opened their mouths. It felt overwhelming rather than strange. Even though they had the same smiles on their faces.


[What are you planning to do with that? Since ancient times, the art of axe-wielding has been learned only on the battlefield.]


“Isn’t this a battlefield too?”




Jeong Yeon-shin answered calmly. The small sword in his left hand spun around in place.


I tried to roll it by making a slight ripple with my heart, and it followed my intention better than I expected.


The light reflected from the axe blade illuminated the face of one of the Ten Masters.


A satisfied smile stands out against the dim backlight. He doesn’t look like he lost his disciples to Jeongyeonshin’s hands.


[I am twelve, so that makes sense. It would be very difficult to find a battlefield like this in the world.]


“Mr. Moonju is a generous person. I appreciate your kindness.”


[…favor?]


Jeongyeonshin did not answer.


It had been a long time since he had cast the spell on both his eyes. At first, the light of his eyes, which had been a light blue color, soon darkened into a deep blue color, and swept over his enemies.


‘That’s amazing.’




From my perspective of study, they are all no different from the one who mixed hands a little while ago.


Because the waves spreading out from the twelve bodies are the same. They are just a bit blurry, like smoke that has taken shape.


‘Gongwolmu.’


The shape, spacing, and density of the aerodynamic waves that swept across the sky in all directions were all identical.


It meant that the first blow was unconditionally on par with the ten most powerful swordsman in the game.


Jeongyeonshin thought. What kind of enlightenment is that?


[Your eyes are creepy. What are you thinking?]


The last of the ten masters to step forward and take up the axe spoke.


A face that had witnessed something extremely ominous. At this moment, the closest physical body to Jeongyeonshin was the body, and unlike the other ten-professional masters, the body lines were distinct.


‘You won’t know until you experience it yourself.’


Jeong Yeon-shin gave up on the mystery of Gongwolmu.


Immediately after that.


A new type of ten-professionalism suddenly filled my eyes. It was a red-hot weapon, rushing in with its bare hands, holding nothing.


The sight of the air burning colorless from the outstretched hands was spectacular.


[There is something that is considered one of the 18 anti-weapons weapons, even though it is not a weapon.]


[Bare-handed back attack.]


Another ten-pronged swordsman. He took over Jeongyeonshin’s left and right in just one step.


[I have no interest in your wanton attitude.]


[If you don’t take revenge on your comrades and disciples here, who would want to come in as a disciple in the text?]


They spoke with thoughts faster than the speed of their lips. Each of them aimed their Bangcheonhwageuk at Jeongyeonshin’s side and struck the Unwoldo at his crown.




Front and sides.


There were three points of contact. The atmosphere was rippling translucently.


Jeong Yeon-shin, who slightly bent her waist, held on tightly to Yeo-roe’s sword. It was right after that that the Neungbeop Gwangryun-gi began to run through the blood vessels of her entire body like a flash of light.


He lowered his stance slightly, stepped forward, and spun around with his sword.


Swish!


He passed right by the side of the Ten-Tier Master who was extending his fist from the front. The new method of the Wind God. For a brief moment, the feeling of the blade scraping against the armor dug into his hand.


Dust swirls beneath my feet.


The reaction of the new method and sword strike. The rapidly spreading whirlpool of light waves wrapped around the hem of his pants and rose, then passed by, wrapping around the Bangcheonhwageuk and the Unwoldo that had chased him behind.


Even the aftereffects of a single blow were used as a starting point for an attack.


Hwaaaaah!


The trajectories of the two guns were twisted.


For a moment, it felt as if the sky behind Jeongyeonshin had opened wide. This meant that the space occupied by the two Ten-Way Masters was filled with a very strict atmosphere.


Jeongyeonshin turned around on the spot.


That alone was enough to properly escape the three-second chain attack. It was complete destruction.


Swish.

——————





Sunlight came down through the blade of the lightning sword held by Magwangikju.


The black robe with dirt on the hem gave off a somewhat old-fashioned and unapproachable vibe. The long hair added to that mood.


A near-perfect unmanned form.


It is a sturdy beauty. Exclamations flowed from the crowd who were lost in the sight of the ten-professional Lee Hyeong-hwan.


[What a truly amazing skill. In addition to lightness, he also has new techniques.]


The bare-handed Ten-Way Master touched his rib cage. The straight sword marks on his armor. It was proof that the swordsmanship of the Magwangikju had cut through his self-defense power in an instant.


[He has the temperament of a nobleman, but he is much more refined and quick. It must be the unripe wheat you made.]


“… … .”


Jeongyeonshin slightly lowered her eyelids.


While feeling the remaining sensation of the sword. It wasn’t the end of cutting the self-defense weapon. The armor of the ten-man army was filled with true energy.


It’s not easy to leave a fatal wound like this, because it’s a situation where it’s difficult to focus entirely on one sword.


The movements of the Bangcheonhwageuk and Unwoldo that had just been recorded in the book were also recalled in my mind. Even though it was a short introduction, it contained the secrets of military techniques.


That was when.


Thud, thud.


The ten experts approached.


[At that time, it was said that the martial arts of the Magwangikju were one of two things.]


[A short-term battle. Either a short and simple fight or a very flashy one.]


[It’s nothing right now.]


[Are you ready to die?]


They disperse, speaking leisurely, one word at a time. It seems natural to look down on Jeong Yeon-shin.




Hwaaaaak!


The sky was overcast and billowy.


An overwhelming sense of pressure began to fill the space. As if it wasn’t something that could be ended with just one attack from the three of them, they closed in, forming a circle-shaped encirclement.


Jeong Yeon-shin swung the axe in her left hand once.


Paang-


It feels good in the palm of your hand. It’s not as good as the Shingeom Yeolleo, but the balance from the blade to the handle isn’t bad either.


‘I need to save my strength.’


Today, at this location, we plan to defeat the three leaders of the thirteen thousand.


I can’t back down here. The blood debt of Iphwangseong should be repaid by the unmanned people of the original nature, and the long-suffering monk of Amipa should not be killed by Geumsimunju.


[Thank you for giving me a big plate.]


[The text was revived even without the intervention of the dragon.]


[It’s okay to cross the Samdo River.]


The ten lords who formed a siege spoke. Was it the leisure unique to the absolute being? The rough voices somehow came across as noble.


Right after.


The bodies of the ten experts all disappeared at once.


It was a light leap.


A sharp hook first covers the sky. A long sickle called a Goeja. Behind him, a dull, cutting sound resonated loudly.


The ten-man warrior holding shields was clashing fiercely.


Jeong Yeon-shin gripped the axe tightly and made a fist.


A translucent air current flowed down from his shoulder to his face. A thick, light wave unique to the fist. Jeongyeonshin, who was spinning in place with dazzling speed, struck the shield.




Shihwamugeuksu, Jeicho Jinbyeok.


Kwaaaaaaaang!


Several layers of ripples erupted from the point of impact. This was because the footwork of the best players was intertwined.


A ten-pronged sword that bounces off to the other side with a shield covered in incense.


The ground swept by the shockwave rose like a tidal wave and covered the surrounding area. I felt the blade of a hook digging into the hair that was rising straight up.


Swish!


A hot sensation ran down my shoulder. It was as if I had been swept by the wide-spread black energy.


Her own blood was reddening one side of her vision, but Jeongyeonshin did not activate her newly created self-defense technique.


It was because he had no intention of showing it in advance to Geumsimunju, who was watching the fight right away.


He didn’t even look back and swung the lightning bolt backwards.


Immediately, a loud noise came down from the blade to the elbow. The body of the scythe, blocked by lightning, twisted in place.


‘This is also a new soldier.’


Jeongyeonshin thought.


A dragon rose from his mind, biting the fan and wrapping itself around Yeo-rae.


The moment he spread his hand, the lightning that passed like a sickle slashed through the neck of the ten-man army below and stuck into the ground.


There was no chance for him to strike again.


bang!


When the ground shakes violently after being struck by lightning.


[Are there about ten layers of light waves overlapping the fist? I can’t take it.]


The ten-man warrior who landed with his shield in the distance raised his blurred body.




[Not only the amount of energy, but also the internal energy management is truly monstrous.]


The head of the person who had lost his head while holding the Bangcheonhwageuk was reappearing. It was as if he had the power of regeneration.


‘I get the general idea.’


Jeongyeonshin felt the energy rushing towards them like a stream of water.


It was an invisible passage of internal energy. It was flowing out from the body of the ten-year-old master who was standing with his arms crossed in the distance.


It seemed as if spirituality and energy had become one and formed a double.


There is a term in Taoist studies to describe such a phenomenon. Jeong Yeon-shin slowly opened his mouth.


“I thought Won Yeong-shin was a swordsman from the shaman faction.”


[Did you notice?]


The ten experts laughed.


[That speech was a great inspiration to me. Although it operates in a different way than mine.]


“Do you have any friendship?”


[The old sect is a Buddhist temple and a Taoist temple. If the imperial family does not turn a blind eye, they cannot spread their influence, so they have to follow the emperor’s will in many matters.


[For example, by capturing and killing spirits and demons, or being drafted to the northern front as a martial arts force.]


The ten experts did not stop walking.


Damn it.


The bushes that had raised their heads green as if welcoming spring were collapsing on their own and returning to the ground. As the gap between us narrowed with each step, the pressure grew stronger.


It’s not because of the aerodynamics. In terms of axial force, Jeongyeonshin has the upper hand.


It was just the thought of the Ten Commandments, which had an immense spirituality, that was creating some kind of premonition at this moment.


Something that penetrates the secret arts of the Eighteen Half-Arms and affects this land with a power beyond true energy.




Saaaaa―


[The Gangho Dongdo were curious.]


They each carried a different type of weapon and surrounded all directions in a circular formation similar to a wheel formation.


[If you dig several wells, you will not be able to get deep enough, so how did I become a peerless expert by mastering the eighteen half-daggers?]


It was like the art of the Jecheon Daeseong depicted on the canvas. Each of them was taking the flag bearing ceremony appropriate for their weapons.


[Because it deals with the principles of military tactics.]


The space seemed to be blocked by something hemispherical that was invisible. There was no ventilation.


It was as if some kind of formation had been unfolded. It was a harmony that had begun to go beyond the realm of martial arts.


Thirteen Heavenly Lords. The pinnacle of the Four Horsemen.


Phew!


It started out of nowhere. The first blow was a meteor. A huge metal ball was suspended from a rope and tore through the air.


It was a blow aimed at the shoulder. It was a technique that could not avoid dislocation if hit directly. A loud noise was heard, as if hundreds of martial artists had thrown their fists at the same time.


The power of the great axe is fully displayed. Jeong Yeon-shin concentrated his light energy from the arm holding the axe to the Gyeonwoo point on his shoulder.


Oh my god!


As soon as he struck the axe with his hammer, the ground sank with a thud. In that moment, Jeong Yeon-shin felt the energy seeping into her wrist bones. It was the moment when her internal stamina technique was applied.


The ten-man warrior holding the meteorite retreated. It was because he lost his energy and became dizzy the moment he struck.


As he was regaining clarity, the ten masters, each armed with a katana, a sword, a sword and a pair of swords, flew in, emitting a cold light.


Swaaa …


A beam of light was engraved on the necks of the two men. The strong wind from the sword technique blew away the dust in a circular shape.


As the two Inyoungs flew away holding the Gujeolpyeon and Bangcheonhwageuk, the divine sword Yeore began to spin around in all directions and strike.


Five of them on the outskirts of the encirclement quickly attached themselves to the torpedoes.


Jeongyeonshin was trapped by seven people. She had to raise the Shihwamu Geuksu’s Gukkeul with her bare hands. Her hands were imbued with the explosive power of Hwankang.


Oh my god! Oh my god!


He struck the spear with the back of his hand and burst the sword energy. Every time he did, the wide peak shook as a whole.


It was full of people who were like that. It was like being surrounded by the hell of the underworld.


The cloudy dust spiraled violently and violently, and shock waves burst out in the middle, forming ten or twenty ripples.


They gradually got faster.


They are the best of the best. The time it took for the speed of the water to reach its peak was incredibly short. As soon as the confrontation situation was formed, all the new forms became blurred in an instant.


Only occasionally did the ten specializations that had to receive the truth become apparent after a time gap. In the meantime, hundreds of rays of light continued to confine Jeongyeonshin.


While the trajectories made of all kinds of weapons continued to roar without stopping.


The light in Jeong Yeon-shin’s eyes flowed here and there like a stream of blue water, following his movements and nods.


[Your movements are worthy of forming a family. Your studies are higher than those of any other eight-legged sect in the world!]


[If the god of war had seen this, he would not have killed him but would have taken him as his disciple. He is a man who should never go to the North.]


[I regret the passage of time!]


[Even if it doesn’t work out, in ten years Kang-ho might have seen the best in the world…]


Saaak! Poohhak!


Even though the phrase struck my side and my shoulder was split by the ten-pronged wave of the Ten Commandments, I didn’t feel any pain. The thrill of pushing my head up only increased.


I have never received such an abundance of opportunities from the enemy. Hundreds of trajectories fill my eyes without stopping.


A sword, a spear, a shield, a large axe, a club, a staff… Countless rays of light, bending and drawing countless variations in the air, were etched into my mind like hot ink.


From the ancient Song Dynasty to the present day.


The 18-Ban Weapons are a group of weapons that have been established over many generations. They contain hundreds of years of history. They were thick enough that Jeongyeonshin could not dare look down on them.


How can I possibly reach that with a life that can barely last nineteen years?


thud!


It was a sound that echoed inside Jeongsu-ri. A lightning bolt of joy struck his mind. It was along with the inferiority complex he had about life.


Innate talent only helped. Deep inside, greed and resentment about time flared up like wildfire.


I want to see you. I have to see you.


He let his body move on its own. It was possible to let his body go with the flow of dodging, turning, and throwing hands without thinking.


It aroused great emotion. All the ten special skills were put into consciousness.


Jeong Yeon-shin deeply sensed the trajectories, methods of phasing, and the subtleties of the waves they were sending out. Just like the gaze of the Seven Sado he had once encountered.


‘ah.’


Something like a wave flows in.


It’s similar to the feeling I experienced at the Gongwolmu of the King of Guimyeong.


It was time.


Overwhelming time enveloped the upper chamber like a cloud. The dreamy feeling was satisfying. Pictures of all the weapons in this place were woven into one volume in my head.


A book of imagination. The roughly written pages were falling apart. There was a lot of space, but Jeongyeonshin didn’t care. It was too narrow to make notes.


[You don’t consider your successors. They say a short battle is a long one.]


[It’s the end.]


A rang out above his head. Two of the Ten Masters were each striking down their spears and clubs.


The waves, which had already changed several times, turned into white and black lightning and burst into loud waves.


Jeongyeon Shin snapped her fingers.


The white wind slammed into their arms and rose. As if the hem of their clothes were wrinkled, their arms became blurry, and the force of their blows rapidly weakened.


At the same time, Jeongyeonshin threw the axe over her head and activated Geumnasoo. She spread out both hands and wrapped them around the two men’s weapons.


Spot!


[… … !]


The next moment, Jeong Yeon-shin snatched the Bangcheonhwageuk and the club from her hands. The black sleeves were billowing violently on both sides.


‘Ten seconds.’


He thought.
