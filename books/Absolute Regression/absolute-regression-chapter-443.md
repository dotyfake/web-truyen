# Absolute Regression Chapter 443 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Chương truyện mở đầu với việc nhân vật chính (tôi) chứng kiến cha mình bước xuống cầu thang. Cậu hồi tưởng lại rằng, khi lớn tuổi hơn, cậu thường nghĩ về cha mình, và giờ đây cậu muốn có một cuộc trò chuyện sâu sắc để hiểu cha hơn.

Cuộc đối thoại bắt đầu bằng một câu hỏi bất ngờ từ cha cậu: "Con ghen tị với đám ma đầu của ta vì chúng quá крутой phải không?". Câu nói này ám chỉ việc cậu từng khen ngợi các Amazon (Amazons) trước mặt họ. Cậu thừa nhận sự ghen tị và còn nói đùa muốn biến họ thành của riêng, khiến Huyết Thiên Đao Ma (Hyeolcheondoma) phải nghiêm khắc nhắc nhở cậu. Cậu xin lỗi và hứa sẽ cẩn trọng hơn trong lời nói, nhận được nụ cười thích thú từ Ma Bộc (Mabul).

Sau đó, cậu nghiêm túc hỏi cha về giấc mơ của ông. Câu hỏi này khiến mọi người căng thẳng, vì ai cũng biết giấc mơ của cha cậu là gì, nhưng họ tò mò về phản ứng của ông. Chùy Ma (Chwima) đứng ra giải vây, hỏi ngược lại về giấc mơ của cậu. Cậu đáp rằng giấc mơ của cậu thường thay đổi, và nhấn mạnh rằng không nhất thiết phải chỉ có một giấc mơ duy nhất. Cậu cũng hỏi Chùy Ma về giấc mơ của anh ta, và anh ta trả lời thay cho cha cậu rằng: "Chúng ta sẽ thống nhất võ lâm dưới sự lãnh đạo của giáo chủ".

Cậu phản biện rằng việc thống nhất võ lâm có thể khiến tình hình tồi tệ hơn, vì các thế lực sẽ tranh giành quyền lực và gây ra nhiều đau khổ. Chùy Ma đưa ra giải pháp kiểm soát bằng sức mạnh, nhưng cậu cho rằng thế giới bị cai trị bằng áp bức không phải là một thế giới tốt đẹp.

Tiếp tục cuộc trò chuyện, cậu bày tỏ mong muốn không ai trong số các Amazon phải chết, không muốn phải sống cuộc đời day dứt vì mất mát. Cậu thừa nhận đây là một nỗ lực ích kỷ để bảo vệ chính mình khỏi nỗi đau mất người thân yêu. Khi cha cậu hỏi về giấc mơ thực sự của cậu, cậu đáp rằng cậu muốn sống một cuộc sống an nhàn trong Thái Sư Điện (Taesa Temple), suy nghĩ xem hôm nay nên thăm vị ma đầu nào hay yêu cầu Thiên Ma Vương (Heavenly Demon King) nấu món gì.

Cha cậu phản bác rằng những lãnh đạo võ林 đạo mà cậu tin tưởng có thể đâm sau lưng cậu. Cậu không trả lời, thừa nhận rằng kinh nghiệm của cha cậu có lý. Cậu hỏi các Amazon liệu có ai sẵn sàng đứng ra giúp đỡ trong tình huống đó không, nhưng không ai đáp lại, ngoại trừ Quyền Ma (Kwon Ma), người nhận xét rằng cậu không thực sự tin tưởng ai cả. Cậu đáp lại rằng ngay cả khi bị lừa dối, cậu cũng đã chuẩn bị sẵn sàng và sẽ sử dụng võ công của mình để tận hưởng cuộc sống.

Cuộc trò chuyện đạt đến cao trào khi cha cậu tiến đến trước mặt Tà Thần (evil Soma) và hỏi liệu anh ta có còn ủng hộ cậu không, ngay cả khi phải từ bỏ chiếc mặt nạ bất tử (Immortal Mask) mà anh ta trân trọng nhất. Tà Thần đáp rằng anh ta có nhiều mặt nạ và sẽ sống cả đời đeo mặt nạ vui vẻ (Hwanrakgwimyeon) bên cạnh cậu.

Cuối cùng, cha cậu hỏi Thiếu Hỗn Ma Quân (Subhonmazon) về việc luyện tập của cô, nhắc nhở cô rằng cô là người của ông. Ông không ép buộc cô phải chọn bên, mà chỉ muốn cô phát triển một cách yên bình. Cô hứa sẽ giải thích mọi chuyện với cậu sau, và rời đi. Cậu trách móc cô là kẻ bạc tình, nhưng trong lòng lại hiểu và chấp nhận quyết định của cô. Chương truyện kết thúc với việc cậu nhận ra sự mạnh mẽ và chu đáo của cha mình, và tự hỏi mình nên làm gì tiếp theo.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-442/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-444/)443  

I watched my father coming down the stairs in silence.




‘Father. Do you know when in my life before my regression did I think of you the most? When you died? When I was looking for materials to get revenge? When I was physically and mentally exhausted? Or when I was lonely? None of those. When I was as old as you.’


I never really had a heart-to-heart talk with my father, so I thought I wouldn’t miss him. I thought it would just be a vague longing.


But, strangely enough, as I got older, I started to think of my father from time to time.


I think now would be a good time to have a deep conversation with my father.


I think I could understand my father a little more now. Now.


My father stopped a few steps in front of me.


Our eyes met in the air. I’ve met my father many times, but never before has there been a moment as tense as today.


Finally, my father asked.


“Are you jealous of my demon lords because they are so cool?”


The first words were meant for me, to let them know that I told them that the Amazons were cool.




I looked around at the Amazons standing on both sides.


I briefly made eye contact with all of them. The emotions in their eyes as they watched us were different.


As always, Kwonma’s eyes were heavy. Next to the calm Ilhwageomjon, there was the half-closed eyes of Chwima, who hid his complicated feelings. Mabul’s eyes were full of interest, Poison King was indifferent, and Blood Heavenly Demon was hot. Seophonmajon was confident, and the evil Soma was smiling.


“Yes. I’m so jealous that I want to make them all my own.”


The first person to react was Hyeolcheondoma.


“Little Leader, please don’t say things like that, even if it’s a joke.”


Bloodthirsty Doma was definitely taking on the role of scolding me today. He knew it. Someone had to do this job today. I was grateful to him.


“What can I do with something cool?”


Bloodthirsty Demon gave him a sharp look. Is this what you are doing? I tried hard to suppress my desire to joke with him and bowed my head politely.


“I’m sorry. I will be more careful with my words and actions in the future.”




I saw Mabul smiling at me while apologizing. He was the happiest person in the audience today.


These days, you’re just carving stone statues and taking a break, so this kind of thing sounds exciting, doesn’t it?


As if responding to my thoughts, the light of the demon lord grew darker.


However, you shouldn’t treat them carelessly. It’s okay to play a prank when you’re alone with the Amazons, or when they’re with each other, but playing a clumsy prank in front of your father could be very rude to the Amazons.


When it comes to pranks, it’s more important to know how to hold back when you want to prank than to actually prank them.


I looked at my father again.


“Father, there is something I want to ask you.”


Everyone’s eyes were focused on me. Amidst the tension, I finally asked my father this question.


“I want to ask, father, what your dream is.”


I can feel everyone flinching. They must be thinking, “Surely they’re going to ask the leader that directly?”




Naturally, everyone’s eyes were focused on my father. They weren’t waiting for an answer. There was no one here who didn’t know what my father’s dream was. They were curious about how my father would react. Would he answer obediently or would he get angry?


My father didn’t answer.


Father’s silence heightened the tension. He didn’t emit any magic or harden his expression, but it made everyone tense.


The one who relieved this rising tension that was about to burst was Chwima. He stepped forward with a tongue-tied voice. At a time like this, only a drunkard could intervene.


“Before asking about the leader’s dream, please tell me about the sub-leader’s dream first.”


“That’s right. I was short-sighted. My dreams change often, so if you ask me later, I might give a different answer.”


I intentionally put these words first so that my father would hear them. Don’t dream of just one dream. Dreams can change.


At that time, Chwima thankfully asked me this question.


“Does our cult leader change his dreams often like he said?”


The quick-witted Chuma knew why I said that.


“Doesn’t it have to be just one dream? We only live once, so we dream this dream and that dream. So what if we don’t have a dream?”


I said this to the drunkard, but I was actually talking to my father. Of course, he knows that too.


I didn’t just let the drunk who invaded the stage go.


“Do you have a dream, Master?”


He would have laughed and said, “I’m just going to spend my whole life drinking.”


“We will unite the martial arts world under the leadership of our cult leader.”


The phrase “the unification of the whole world” was used by Chwima instead. He knew that his father would not say that on his own.


I will step in your place, so use me to say what you want to say to the cult leader.


This is how he repaid the guilt he felt towards his father.


“Do you think the world will become a better place if the martial arts world unites?”




Yeah, I couldn’t ask my father that directly.


“At least it will be better than it is now.”


“No, I think it will get worse.”


“What makes you think so?”


“Imagine a world where the Mines, the Jeongpas, and the Sapas are all united. The Mines will try to suppress the Jeongpas and the Sapas because we are united, and the Sapas, feeling defeated, will commit even more heinous evil deeds. The Jeongpas will find every way to reclaim the Jeongpa martial arts world. There will be countless sacrifices in the process. In the end, it will be a world where everyone is dissatisfied.”


My father and the demons were quietly listening to me.


“Can’t we just control that chaos strongly?”


On their behalf, Chwima came up with a solution.


“Is the world where the martial arts world is ruled by oppression and control, the world where the martial arts world is unified, really like that?”


I said this after seeing the drunkard, but what I am saying now is exactly what I would say to my father.


I have actually experienced it. The martial arts world where the balance of the magician has collapsed. And the nature of power never allows for vacancy.


Another power called the Twelve Earthly Kings took their place, and life became more difficult for the martial artists.


The same will be true for us. Palmazone will take the place of the Twelve Kings.


“I think it’s a world that shouldn’t have come together in the first place.”


Thanks to the encouragement from the horse, I was able to say everything I wanted to say.

Now that I had sent Chwima off the stage, I looked at my father. I couldn’t tell what my earlier words had meant to him.


Because my father was looking at me with the same expression as before.


“Father, beyond all else, I don’t want to lose anyone here.”


“No one here is afraid of death.”


“Yes, I know. I know that they are all brave men. I also know that they would not hesitate to give up their lives on the orders of their father. This is only my personal feeling. It is my greed that I do not want to lose these men.”


I looked around at the Amazons with serious eyes.


“I don’t want to lose a single person here. If one person dies, won’t there be seven left? No, I will miss that one person for the rest of my life.”


My father probably wouldn’t understand. Why I want to save him so badly? He probably wouldn’t know the efforts I made before my regression to save the people who needed to be saved.


My gaze, which had been directed at the demons, turned to my father.


“To be honest, this is an effort for my life. Yes, it is. It is my effort not to live a life missing the dead.”


“Is that your dream?”


“No, this is my personal wish. It’s just my selfishness.”


“Then what is your dream?”


My father allowed me to say everything on this stage. It was as if I was the main character on this stage.


Say whatever you want to say in front of me and the Amazons.


So maybe it’s going to be a more difficult fight.


“My dream is to live in that temple and ponder.”


Everyone, including my father, looked puzzled. They probably wouldn’t know what I meant just by saying this.


“I will sit in the Grand Master’s office and think about it. Which Demon Lord should I visit today? What dish should I ask the Heavenly Demon King to make?”


“Does that place look so empty?”




“I know not. I know how much work my father does in that place.”


I calmly asked my father, who had an expression on his face like, “I know, but why are you saying that?”


“So shouldn’t we think about it more? We can’t just work our whole lives.”


“!”


The atmosphere became quiet again because it was an obvious provocation to my father. Although my father was still there, the reactions of the demons created the atmosphere.


“How can I work efficiently? How can I make the most of my time? I will think about it every day. When I get bored, I will go play with the leader of the martial arts world. When I get tired of teasing that old-fashioned person, I will go to the leader of the sado world and ask if my dancing skills are still the same. This is my dream to live.”


My real dream is not to be trapped in that temple. To roam the world and live freely. That is my real dream.


But I couldn’t say that in front of my father. I couldn’t tell my father, who had lived his whole life for the school at that Taesa Temple, about that dream. And I couldn’t tell him about my brother, who had been pushed out of that Taesa Temple.


So what I am saying now is a compromise for my dream. Father, isn’t it possible for dreams to be compromised like this? Isn’t it possible that we treat them too preciously and end up not achieving them?


“What about you, father? Don’t you want to live that kind of life?”


My answer and my question were on a fine line. But if I don’t speak so strongly, I can’t face my father on this stage. I can’t convince him.


But the reality my father thought of was cold.


“That old-fashioned martial arts leader you mentioned will one day stab you in the back and say he had no choice. He couldn’t help it because he was the martial arts leader. And he’ll look down at your dying eyes and continue making unreasonable arguments.”


Kwonma, Ilhwageomjon, and Mabul nodded. Hyeolcheondoma and Chwima didn’t react either, but their expressions weren’t much different from their father’s thoughts.


Because I didn’t trust the political parties, regardless of their relationship with me. And how could that distrust be limited to the political parties?


“How long will the Apostle Leader be able to dance? When will a surprise attack emerge from that dance? Do you really believe that humans will not change? Do you believe that they will remain strong in the face of circumstances or interests?”


I didn’t answer. I could have argued back if I had wanted to, but I didn’t. At least in this part, it was a decision made by my father’s long life and experience.


I sighed lightly and said softly.


“Maybe so.”


Then I looked around at the Amazons.




“Isn’t there anyone who can step forward and help in a situation like this? Reverend, that’s not necessarily the case! Someone who can!”


Bloodthirsty Demon said with his eyes. Hey, don’t mess around. Seriously!


Mabul was so happy that he was smiling brightly.


Ilhwageomjon had an apologetic look in his eyes, and Chwima pretended to be drunk.


And at this moment, a truly unexpected person stepped forward.


“The young leader won’t be easily defeated.”


It wasn’t the evil Soma. It was the person who would never step forward, Kwon Ma.


“It may only seem that way on the outside, but the leader of the cult doesn’t trust people very much.”


“As expected! The master knows his disciple well. But is that a compliment or an insult?”


I spoke to my father again.


“Even if they fool me, it’s okay. I’ve been practicing martial arts like crazy in preparation for that moment. The sword behind my back won’t be able to pierce my skin, and in the end, the dance will just be a dance.”


“Are you going to let all the martial arts you worked so hard to build up go to waste?”


“I want to enjoy life with that skill.”


“Just worrying about what to eat and where to go to play?”


“Yes, that will happen.”


My father, who had been staring at me, slowly started walking away.


The place my father was headed to was in front of the evil Soma.


The evil Soma had a calm look in his eyes, but I was rather nervous.


“Are you still going to support the cult leader?”


It was a burdensome question, because the question itself implied a demand for a no answer.




But just like his pure white mask, the heart of the evil Soma was of one mind.


“Yes, I support the will of the sect leader.”


His father asked him again.


“Even if I can’t use that immortal mask for the rest of my life?”


The Immortal Mask was the mask that the evil Soma wore when he went to war. When the Mazones stood before my father for me in the past, the evil Soma wore the Immortal Mask and asked my father.


Since it was his most cherished mask, it hit him where it hurt the most.


But the evil Soma spoke to his father more politely than ever.


“Luckily, I have several masks.”


The gaze of the evil soma that was directed at my father turned to me.


“I will live my whole life wearing a mask of pleasure with the leader of the cult.”


The Hwanrakgwimyeon was a mask worn during large events or banquets within the school.


Even though he had given up his favorite mask, his eyes were clear and deep under the mask. Those eyes when he revealed his true feelings.


This is the only way I can repay the sincerity I showed to my father, of all people.


I will make that banquet the grandest banquet ever.


All the Mazones looked at the evil Soma. Each of their eyes had different emotions in them.


Father didn’t speak to the evil Soma anymore. Could it be that Father asked without knowing the evil Soma’s reaction?


This time, my father stood in front of the Demon Lord.


She was confident even in front of her father. Everyone knew that her father did not like the Poison King and the Sub-Honma-Jon. That is why she tried to be more confident.


I thought my father would ask me why I sided with the sect leader, but he asked me an unexpected question.


“Is your training going well?”




Although he was inwardly embarrassed by the gentle question, the Subhonmazon answered politely.


“I am practicing hard.”


I thought he would just encourage me and then turn around.


“Don’t forget. You are my Demon Lord.”


This time, the Subhonmajon was surprised and touched. She was the one he thought was out of his father’s sight.


“Are you still going to stand here?”


The Subhonmazone was embarrassed. She looked at me.


There are many times when I don’t know what my father is thinking, but at least I know this for sure.


In this situation, it is not the person who pressures the young Amazon to take him to himself.


What does that mean? It’s not that my father is pressuring me, he’s just trying to take care of her.


It’s not yet time for her to grow up. It’s her father’s heart and consideration to let her grow up quietly among the demons.


I conveyed my feelings to her with my eyes.


It’s okay to go.


The Sub-Hon-Ma-Jon, who noticed my intentions, politely offered me a prize.


“I will explain it to you later.”


She walked across the red carpet and stood on the other side.


Of course, I said something completely different from the look I gave her.


“You’re going too far! Did you really think about who you’d spend the rest of your life with before deciding? Where in the world can you find such a spineless ghost!”


Mabul, who was standing next to her, smiled brightly.


‘It’s not easy, is it?’


On this stage, my father was strong.


He was leading this stage while taking care of and being considerate of me, the evil Soma, and even the Subhonmazone.


My father never got excited. His fights were dignified and noble.


All the Amazons’ eyes were turned towards me. The question in their eyes was the same.


Master, what are we going to do now?
