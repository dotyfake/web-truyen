# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 211 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Tại Cung Gugu, Jeong Yeonshin bước vào tẩm cung của ông nội, Mayeonjeok, người đang nằm yếu ớt trên giường. Margin, tân gia chủ Iphwangma, không thể đến vì bận rộn với việc củng cố vị thế.

Mayeonjeok từ chối dùng Linh Bài Triệu Hồi (Shaolin Summoning Corps) mà Jeong Yeonshin giành được, vì ông cho rằng đó là phần thưởng cho nhiệm vụ của cháu mình. Jeong Yeonshin đến để dùng Đại Hoàn Đan (Daehwandan) hồi phục ông nội. Mayeonjeok vẫn kiên quyết từ chối, cho rằng không thể nhận phần thưởng của cháu trai.

Jeong Yeonshin khẳng định sẽ dùng Đại Hoàn Đan theo ý mình và lấy hộp gỗ đựng đan dược ra. Mùi hương thoang thoảng tỏa ra, một linh khí khác biệt lan tỏa. Bất ngờ, Jeong Yeonshin nuốt viên Đại Hoàn Đan vào bụng. Cậu nói lời xin lỗi và đẩy tấm chăn lụa ra, đặt tay lên bụng dưới của ông nội. Mayeonjeok kinh ngạc nhận ra đó là thuật Liên Hoàn Tỏa (the power of the interlocking chain) - một bí thuật truyền công lực.

Jeong Yeonshin tập trung cao độ, cậu sử dụng thuật Neungbeop Gwangryungi để tăng cường khả năng hấp thụ đan dược. Một nguồn năng lượng khổng lồ bùng nổ từ bụng dưới, lan tỏa khắp cơ thể. Cậu nhận ra tại sao Thiếu Lâm lại được tôn sùng là đệ nhất Trung Nguyên, Đại Hoàn Đan quả thực là bảo vật. Nguồn năng lượng tinh khiết lan tỏa, không cần vận chuyển nhiều lần bằng Chính Gia Định Công (Jeonggadonggong).

Cậu dùng Chính Gia Định Công (Jeonggadonggong) để truyền năng lượng vào cơ thể Mayeonjeok. Ý chí của cậu, như vòng tay của người con gái ôm lấy cha mình, thấm vào cơ thể ông. Mayeonjeok nhăn mày, đó là dấu hiệu của sự thay đổi.

Trong lúc đó, các thuộc hạ của Ma Gwang-ik đang bàn tán về tình hình khó khăn của Trường Thiên Đại (Changcheon University) do Kim Sim Môn (Geumsimun clan) gây ra, sự mất tích của Thuần Thiên Nhất (Suncheonik), và sự xuất hiện của các thế lực khác trong giang hồ. Đột nhiên, một người phụ nữ trung niên mặc áo bào đen xuất hiện trước cổng, khí thế áp đảo, sử dụng Kim Tiên Bát Pháp (Geumseon Palbeop). Bà ta lên tiếng chỉ trích sự chia rẽ và can thiệp vào chuyện gia tộc của Iphwangma.

Gugu Palace.


The sunset that was pouring down in one direction was cut off by the stone sliding door.


The door, which closed tightly with a dull sound, seemed to be telling the new Magwangikju to brace himself. Jeong Yeonshin accepted it that way.


The doorknob was rough and creaky, and my fingertips brushed against it.


Damn it.


I entered the inner quarters of the palace. It was the place prepared by Iphwangma Gaju Marjin.


My uncle was busy with many things.


That’s because he’s the new head of the household.


It was said that the higher the military power of the members, the more difficult it was to maintain discipline in a martial arts guild.


The Iphwangma family was a prestigious family whose one-armed margin was worthy of being called a classic.




The letter he sent to Jeong Yeon-shin also showed his hardships. It contained a phrase that said he had to prove many things.


He didn’t even come to see the secret meeting between Seonmokryongju Cheon Soso and Jeong Yeonshin.


‘I guess it’s true that it couldn’t be done.’


As Qingming came into view, the words he had said came to mind.


It was a well-known fact that the eyes of their mysterious clan were somewhat piercing into the hearts of others.


The man who had just been subdued by Cheongmyeong was clearly a warrior of Maga.


There is only one reason to be reluctant.


‘Joo Yeon-jeong.’


The movement of the Purple Master’s body is equivalent to that of a major mission.


Margin was forced to do so at Jeongyeonshin’s request.




He secretly smuggled out the money. It was clearly an act that exceeded the authority of the head of the household. If the truth were known, it would be difficult to avoid responsibility.


‘That might be what Joo Yeon-jeong is after.’


That will be the case if there are no notable achievements.


Due to the nature of the state in which the law exists, it is usually not possible to achieve even this.


It’s okay.


Jeongyeonshin took this task seriously. However, she did not think of it as something that was too difficult.


It has a Jeonggadonggong and Daehwandan.


I was convinced that my grandfather’s body would be revived. That was the reason why I did not ask the Lord of the Heavenly Palace to protect me.


Before she was a teacher, she was a very difficult being to approach. The word supreme is correct.


The picture of him and Ma Gwang-ik reaching out for something they could handle was not drawn.




It would have been a hundred times better to have been in conflict with Joo Yeon-jeong.


Such dogmatism is no longer a hit.


It was a discretionary power exercised as the grandson of Mayeonjeok and the lord of Iphwangseong.


With that in mind, I entered the room closest to the door. The first thing I saw was Mayeonjeok’s face lying on the large bed.


He looked very skinny with his eyes closed. His once shiny white beard looked disheveled. It was hard to find any trace of the appearance of a peerless master.


“Grandfather.”


Jeongyeonshin whispered carefully.


No answer came back.


Only after he reached the head of the bed did Mayenjeok’s wrinkled eyelids flutter. Soon, his unfocused pupils were revealed.


The old man’s eyes took in his grandson’s beautiful face. The soft, relaxed eyes were etched into Jeongyeonshin’s heart.


“You’ve returned… … .”


The corners of Mayanjeok’s mouth formed a faint curve.


It was a loving smile. Jeong Yeon-shin felt the warmth of family that she had longed for since she was young.


That’s why I had a hard time opening my lips.


“I left the summoning tablet behind, so why didn’t you eat it?”


I found out through a letter sent by Margin.


Shaolin Summoning Corps.


It said it was still being kept. There was a note saying to come back and get it again sometime.


When Mayeonjeok found out that the Summoning Ceremony was a reward for his grandson’s mission, he adamantly refused to eat it.


– Yeonshin, I guess I won’t be able to withstand your grandfather’s stubbornness.




There was a threat from the Ma-yeon faction regarding the margin. They said that if you force-feed it to them, they will immediately cut you off.


Jeong Yeon-shin’s lips slightly lowered as she recalled the words of Margin.


Mayenjeok’s smile grew a little deeper.


“Wasn’t it the reward for your mission? How could I take it?”


“That’s what Soson wanted.”


“What did you do just now?”


Mayeonjeok’s white eyebrows rose slightly.


He reacted immediately to the word ‘So-son’. His eyelids trembled, showing that he was slightly moved.


It was the first time I had ever used the word ‘Jeongyeonshin’. The awkwardness tickling my mind rose to the top of my head.


Jeong Yeon-shin, who had become serious without realizing it, immediately changed the subject.


“I came to see you today on a different matter.”


“No, I asked what you said.”


“I have obtained the Daehwandan from the Moorim Alliance. Now, I wish to revive my grandfather’s spirit.”


The new leader, Ma Gwang-ik, spoke of the treasure of the martial arts world as something as trivial as if it were a health tonic.


I did it that way on purpose because it had no further use.

Samhwachwijeong is a state that you will definitely reach at some point. Even if you look at the short time given to you, it is the same.


There is no reason to prioritize him over his maternal grandfather, who may die at any moment.


“I have heard of your exploits. They are truly admirable. Your martial arts skills are already on a level that can be discussed throughout the world. Swordsman Hyun So-baek, that guy is no ordinary old man… … .”


Mayeonjeok smiled faintly with his eyes wide open. He changed the name of Geomseong to Geomchi.


It was foolish. It was something that could be said because it was a joke.


“Anyway, the Great Transformation… … I wished for it at least once in my reckless days. Regardless of my achievements, it was a potion that I couldn’t obtain because it was missing. However… … .”


The old man continued with a smile.


“That too is yours to take. Wasn’t it yours? Old man can never eat it.”


“Didn’t you save me from the hands of the Blood Flame Cultist? If you had taken action too late, you would have died. Please give me a chance to repay your kindness. I am now the great lord of Ma Gwang-ik. I don’t want to live in debt.”


Jeong Yeon-shin’s speech was unusually long. Her even tone conveyed the determination that it should be so.


The reason why I have been active in the exclusive martial arts alliance is revealed today.


In the story of the extermination of demons by Mayeonjeok, I felt the love that only blood relatives can give. The sight of my grandfather being purified was the true reward.


“Even though I can’t eat it. It’s a matter of principle and reason.”


“There is no such thing in the world.”


You don’t have to eat it yourself. Just restoring the purple energy and gaining the achievements will be enough.


To that extent, we will be able to somewhat catch up with our predecessors who have already gone ahead of us. If we really want to look into the future, that would be enough.


However, Mayeonjeok slightly turned his gaze to the side.


It was a stubborn ignorance.


“This old man… has never been a good grandfather to you. But I can’t accept something like that without shame. Margin, I’ll have to go scold him. How dare he… move an old man for something like this.”


Words spoken intermittently, a wrinkled face and pale complexion.




However, there was a clear expression of anger between Ma Yeon-jeok’s eyebrows. It was anger directed at his son Ma Jin.


Jeong Yeon-shin decided not to continue the argument any longer.


The way he caused his opponent to give up gave me a glimpse of my maternal grandfather’s younger days.


Even when fighting, wouldn’t they have turned the enemy’s clothes inside out? Their conduct toward their fellows would have been similar.


Jeongyeonshin thought. I shouldn’t become like my grandfather.


I slowly moved my lips away.


“As my grandfather said, the Daehwandan is mine. I will use it as I wish, so I don’t think my grandfather has any room to interfere. I will do as I see fit.”


“… … .”


“I will open it.”


He took out a wooden box containing the Daehwandan from his bosom.


It was a box of sandalwood smaller than the palm of one’s hand.


A faint fragrance rose. Even though it was sealed, a distinctly divine aura was felt.


The efficacy of the elixir containing the secret techniques of the monks of the famous tribe was said to be very mysterious.


I knew it was true from the moment I received it from Ye So-jeo of the Murim Alliance.


This elixir is definitely a treasure.


Click.


I opened the top of the warm wooden box inside my arms.


At the same time, the scent of the medicine disappeared. The white pills, clumped together like pebbles, seemed to be protecting their medicinal properties.


It was as if he had mastered his abilities as if he had been imbued with spirituality. It was a mystery of the martial arts world. It was just as I had heard since I was young.


However, Mayeonjeok didn’t even pay attention to Daehwandan.




The old man’s eyes looked straight up at his grandson.


“The old man said he wouldn’t eat it. Are you planning on forcing it into his mouth…?”


Jeongyeonshin did not answer.


I have already absorbed Jasodan into the Hwasanpa’s Yoo Hyeon. And that was when he was white.


Now that I have become more proficient in my studies thanks to the Neungbeop Gwangryungi, things are different.


In the same way as before, I could do even better than before.


Swish.


Jeongyeonshin boldly took out the Shaolin Temple’s Daehwandan and swallowed it. It had no smell or taste.


The English word simply melted naturally into my throat. It was a calm yet ominous momentum. It seemed as if it would reach my lower abdomen in an instant.


“Grandfather, I will beg you to excuse me for a moment.”


Jeong Yeon-shin carefully pushed away the silk quilt that her grandfather had been covering.


The old man’s eyes, wide open and watching his grandson, hardened. It must have been because his hand had touched the lower abdomen.


“The power of the interlocking chain… …!”


Mayeonjeok muttered as if he was groaning.


A technique for transferring energy to others. It is a secret technique that requires extreme physical strength.


It’s okay. Such side effects won’t occur to the current Jeongyeonshin.


Magwangikju Seomye didn’t care at all. There was something more urgent.


‘Hurry up.’


I didn’t have time to check my grandfather’s expression.


It was different from Jasodan. Daehwandan melted into my whole body as soon as I ate it.




It seemed as if a wildfire had broken out in the Seokmunhyeol (石門穴) where the lower abdomen was located.


Even before I could complete the Great Circulation, which circulates the blood vessels of my upper body, an immense amount of energy came up first.


Wooooowoong―


A low resonance came from within my body. My entire body felt hollow, as if my muscles had turned into a cave.


This was because energy that had never been seen before had filled the meridians, veins, and blood vessels.


The efficacy of Daehwandan is.


It was huge.


I understand why the name of Sungsan Shaolin is called the best in the Central Plains. Daehwandan is the secret elixir of Shaolin Temple.


It is said that monks from all sorts of clans spent decades creating one.


The power spreading through my entire body right now was strangely weak. It came to me with a clean feeling, as if it had already been refined.


It was so pure that it was hard to believe. It was enough that it didn’t require the circulation of Jeonggadonggong’s energy many times.


Several heavy throbbing sounds occurred below Jeongyeonshin’s belly button.


“You should use Jeonggadonggong, not Haphwasingong.”


Even when raising your voice during a training session, your energy does not waver.


It was the ability of Jeonggadonggong to train internal energy by moving the body, and it was an innate ability to control internal energy.


He drew out the energy as it was. A transparent wave spread from the fingertips that touched his grandfather’s lower abdomen.


Woof.


If we are rejected here, both of us run the risk of being possessed by the coin.


“Ugh… … .”


Mayeonjeok closed his eyes with a faint sigh.




Jeongyeonshin’s lips slightly rose.


This is the second time I have examined the body of the Purple Peerless Master. He is the previous Master of the New Sword, following the previous Master of the New Sword.


Jeongyeonshin’s consciousness descended into the body of the purple master close to the universe.


Just by observing, all kinds of enlightenment flowed in.


How would the muscles and veins have been woven together when they were strong, where the blood vessels and muscle bundles that my maternal grandfather mainly used were, what kind of system he used his body as a result of those traces, how the three types of Danjeon were formed… … .


He gathered all that knowledge and began to circulate the energy of the Great Transformation through his grandfather’s acupuncture points.


While repeating the most necessary martial arts tips at this moment.


‘mother…….’


The power that has penetrated Mayeonjeok’s body is imbued with Jeonggadonggong’s will.


The daughter hugged her father.


Suddenly, Mayeonjeok’s eyebrows turned black. Instantly, even the wrinkles around his eyes tightened.


It was a sign of change.


\* \* \*


“I heard that there was a request for support from Changcheon University. It looks like they’re having quite a hard time.”


“I heard. The Geumsimun clan is acting unusually well. I have no idea what those crazy guys are up to. At least the Tang clan is cooperating and training with Changcheondae… … Rumor has it that the Changcheondae clan lost to Geumsimunju. I wonder if he survived.”


“Is Suncheonik still out of contact? I heard Jeon Seo-gu isn’t coming back.”


“Since there is no branch in Xinjiang, I guess… … .”


“Isn’t that a magical realm in the first place? It’s also where the previous lord lost his male companion.”


“Do you really need to tell that story… … .”


It was a conversation shared by the blue-collar workers of Ma Gwang-ik.


Surrounding the pavilion, he was relaxed even though his spirit was sharp like a blade.


Most of them had more experience in martial arts than the great master, Jeong Yeon-shin. Their knowledge was also much broader.


It meant that he was used to being able to relax without neglecting his duties.


“What’s even scarier is the faction of the Simawei clan and the masters of the Daebangpa clan. I’ve heard rumors that Yeolingju and Cheongeukmunju are touring the Thirteen Heavens. It seems that the fact that the Sega clans formed a meeting was quite impressive.”


“The Thirteen Thousand-Year Blind Date? What a terrible… … .”


“If that is truly the case, even nature will not be able to handle it.”


“Arthur. Even Sima Wei can’t do that to those guys.”


“Anyway, this is an unprecedented time of chaos. It must be because of the famine. They say there is a shortage of food, even more than the hermitage, so the leaders of the Daebangpa have no choice but to be bold… … .”


That was when.


From far beyond the main gate.


“That’s right. Trouble is coming.”


Even though I didn’t shout, my voice rang out clearly.


The blue-haired masters had already sensed the presence. Each of them turned their heads without being surprised.


She was a middle-aged woman wearing a black robe.


The silk covering her body was dyed with pitch-black paint. Her slender face exuded elegance.


He was surrounded by overwhelming prayers using the Imperial Martial Arts, Geumseon Palbeop, and his eyes seemed to be looking down on the world.


The main character of the Iphwangma family.


“But you are encouraging division. Don’t you have any shame in meddling in your family’s affairs without even knowing the situation?”


She licked her red lips.
