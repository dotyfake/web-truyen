# Absolute Regression Chapter 130 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Chương truyện bắt đầu với cuộc trò chuyện căng thẳng giữa nhân vật chính (tôi) và Chwima (Túy Ma), một trong Tam Ma. Túy Ma hỏi tại sao cậu lại mua loại rượu mà ông ta tìm kiếm trước khi chết, nghi ngờ cậu biết điều gì đó. Cậu giả vờ không biết và nói rằng chỉ mua ngẫu nhiên. Túy Ma có vẻ không tin, nhưng cậu chuyển hướng bằng cách hỏi ngược lại về ý nghĩa của loại rượu này.

Sau đó, Túy Ma chuyển sang hỏi về kinh nghiệm say xỉn của cậu. Cậu kể một chút về quá khứ của mình. Túy Ma cười nhạo, cho rằng cậu còn trẻ nên chưa hiểu hết. Để xoa dịu, cậu nói Túy Ma hãy uống rượu nếu tức giận. Túy Ma lập tức nổi giận, đập vỡ ly và ném chúng vào góc phòng.

Túy Ma mời cậu uống, nhưng cậu từ chối vì muốn giữ tỉnh táo để đối phó với một người say. Cậu chỉ uống sau khi Túy Ma hứa sẽ không nhờ cậu giúp đỡ khi say. Cậu uống một ngụm và thấy rượu rất mạnh. Để Túy Ma ăn thêm, cậu lấy kim bạc ra thử độc thức ăn. Túy Ma tức giận, cho rằng cậu coi ông ta là kẻ hạ độc. Túy Ma ăn hết thức ăn mà cậu thử để chứng minh sự vô tội. Cậu khuyên Túy Ma nên ăn nhiều thức ăn hơn để giữ gìn sức khỏe, vì không muốn ông ta chết vì nghiện rượu.

Trong lúc cả hai cùng uống, cậu không quên tâng bốc Túy Ma. Cậu khen Túy Ma đẹp trai, nhưng cũng nói rằng vẻ đẹp đó khiến ông ta trở nên xa cách. Túy Ma thích thú kể về thời hoàng kim của mình, khi được nhiều phụ nữ theo đuổi. Đột nhiên, Túy Ma cởi áo và nhảy xuống hồ tắm. Sau khi bơi lội một lúc, ông ta trở lại với cơ thể đầy sẹo.

Sau khi tắm xong, Túy Ma lại tiếp tục uống. Ông ta thú nhận lý do thực sự gọi cậu đến là vì không ai tìm kiếm ông ta, kể cả cậu và Lãnh Chúa Tể Thiên (Grand Duke). Cậu đáp rằng Túy Ma không có vẻ gì là quan tâm đến cuộc chiến quyền lực. Túy Ma phản bác, cho rằng việc thích rượu và việc tranh giành quyền lực là hai chuyện khác nhau. Cậu thừa nhận rằng mình đã có định kiến về Túy Ma.

Cậu hỏi Túy Ma có gửi rượu cho anh trai mình không, và Túy Ma xác nhận là có, nhưng anh trai cậu đã gửi trả lại một chai rượu vỡ. Túy Ma hỏi cậu nghĩ gì khi thấy chai rượu vỡ đó, và cậu đáp lại bằng câu nói mà Túy Ma đã từng nói. Túy Ma cười lớn và đề nghị kết nghĩa huynh đệ với cậu. Cậu thắc mắc tại sao anh trai mình lại từ chối Túy Ma, trong khi đang thiếu một Ma Đầu (Amazon). Cậu tự nhủ cần tìm hiểu lý do.

Túy Ma bắt đầu say hơn, và suýt nữa lại nhảy xuống hồ tắm, nhưng cậu đã ngăn lại. Cậu xin phép rời đi, và Túy Ma đồng ý. Trước khi đi, cậu hỏi Túy Ma câu hỏi mà Ian đã hỏi cậu: "Khi nào thì ông uống thấy ngon và thích thú nhất?". Túy Ma trả lời rằng ông luôn cảm thấy ly rượu mình đang uống là ngon nhất, dù là uống một mình hay với người lạ. Túy Ma gục xuống ngủ.

Trên đường trở về, cậu được Diệp Bân (Yeo-bin) đưa thuyền qua hồ. Cậu nhìn lại và thấy Túy Ma đang bám vào lan can, với vẻ mặt thờ ơ. Cậu không thể hiểu được Túy Ma là người như thế nào.

Sau khi rời khỏi Đại Trù Lâm (Daechurim), cậu đến tìm Huyết Thiên Đồ Ma (Hyeolcheon Doma). Cậu hỏi Huyết Thiên Đồ Ma nghĩ gì về Túy Ma. Huyết Thiên Đồ Ma gọi Túy Ma là kẻ gian tà (sinister). Cậu hỏi nếu phải chọn giữa Cực Ác Tố Ma (evil Soma) và Túy Ma, ông ta sẽ chọn ai. Huyết Thiên Đồ Ma không thể chọn dễ dàng. Huyết Thiên Đồ Ma ghét những kẻ say xỉn vì họ thay đổi khi say và khi tỉnh. Ông ta cũng tiết lộ rằng chưa ai từng thấy Túy Ma tỉnh táo. Huyết Thiên Đồ Ma cảnh báo cậu nên cẩn thận vì kẻ gian tà đang bắt đầu hành động. Cậu tự hỏi mục đích của việc Túy Ma gửi rượu cho mình là gì.

**NOTICE: Many of the novels have been removed because they might cause violations, which we were not aware of earlier.**




[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-129/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-131/)The 130th is the very definition of prejudice.




Silence fell.


It was a rather long and heavy silence for two people to endure in one space.


The liquor I bought was the liquor he had been looking for just before he died. It was liquor sold at a brewery near Cheonmasingyo, but no one knew why he wanted to drink this liquor. Chwima died after drinking this liquor.


“Why did you buy that alcohol?”


His voice was trembling as much as his eyes.


Judging by his reaction, I could tell there was definitely some story behind this drink.


I pretended not to know and made excuses to him.


“I’m in a bad mood. You expected some great liquor, but I just stopped by somewhere and bought it. If you sent me an empty bottle to test me, you should have been prepared to get some common liquor from the neighborhood. Didn’t I tell you how I felt when I received the empty bottle?”


When I replied that I bought it without any particular intention, Chwima looked at me for a moment as if glaring.


“Why are you like that? Shouldn’t you have bought this liquor?”




To reduce suspicion, you should ask questions instead. Rather than avoiding, you should dig in. Rather, you should ask openly.


“Is there any meaning to this drink?”


When I looked at him with a rather suspicious look, Chwima slyly changed the subject.


“You have a bad temper.”


“Who wouldn’t be there? Everyone just has to endure it.”


Chwima suddenly got up and relaxed his posture, leaning back against the chair again.


“Did you say you know the mind of a drunk person? How?”


“I was into it once too.”


Then he laughed openly.


“And a young drunkard is not recognized as a drunkard?”




The young man’s story that I had told him earlier was followed by a series of counter-questions as to whether it was a story or not.


“I understand. Anything is intense at that age.”


“Don’t laugh.”


“I’m not laughing at you. You can’t help it when you get older. I don’t want to act like an unlucky senior who shows off and tries to teach me.”


“You are doing that right now.”


“So you can’t do anything about age, right? When you get angry, drink that alcohol.”


Then he got angry and drank his alcohol in a gulp.


“shit!”


He put down his glass with a loud noise. The glass broke. When he raised his hand, the broken glasses floated into the air and flew to a corner. There, a pile of broken glasses was left.


The drunkard said as he poured wine into a new glass.




“I told you to have a drink too.”


“I’m angry, but I won’t drink.”


“why?”


“I came here today with the intention of not drinking. If I drink while dealing with a drunk, what will the result be?”


“That’s a good idea, but haven’t you ever thought about this? How can you deal with a drunkard without drinking?”


“Then promise me one thing. Just drink today.”


“Isn’t that what I should be saying? Please don’t ask me for help when you’re drunk.”


“great.”


I drank the entire bottle of alcohol I brought. Even though I only drank a little, my throat felt hot.


“It’s strong. Would you like to try this?”


Chwima shook his head.


I walked over to the drunkard with a bottle of alcohol in my hand and sat down across from him at the table.


“I have to eat snacks while drinking.”


“A drunkard has no sense of humor.”


“Health is more important than looks. I’m not a drinker either.”


He took out a silver needle and checked the food to see if it was poisoned. The sight made Chuma furious.


“Do I seem like the kind of person who would poison or feed poisonous food to guests?”


“So, aren’t you checking to see if he’s that kind of person or not?”


The crowbar grabbed the food he was trying to check with a silver needle and ate it with its bare hands.


“What do you think of me? There’s no such thing! Just eat me!”




“I don’t like it. How can I believe it?”


When I put the silver needle in another dish, he ate that too first.


“Trust me. I hate people who put poison or drugs in their drinks or snacks! I’m the kind of person who eats people alive.”


I spoke calmly to him, who was very angry.


“You enjoy the side dishes. Please continue to eat like that. Think of the sincerity of the person who prepared them. Are the side dishes flowers? Just look at them.”


To be honest, I came here on purpose to tell you this and eat some snacks. I don’t think anyone around me would dare tell a drunkard to eat some snacks.


You, if you keep going like this, you’ll die from alcoholism. You’re someone who likes alcohol so much and is proud of it, but you can’t die from alcohol, right?


This was a separate issue from whether he would be on my side or on my brother’s side. Even if he committed an evil deed and died by my hand, I would rather die by being stabbed with a sword.


Wouldn’t it be a miserable thing if a person spent his whole life loving and enjoying one thing, and then died because of it?


If he saw his future self, I can guarantee you, he would kill himself.


“Come on, let’s have a drink.”


“If you don’t eat side dishes, I won’t eat.”


“Is it okay? Is it okay?”


“great.”


We drank together. He drank even though he gave the impression that it would be hard if he drank more, that it would be hard. He gradually got drunker.

In the meantime, my flattery attempt was made without fail.


“You are the most handsome of all the Palmazones.”


“Those are pants that anyone would recognize.”


The art of flattery requires the art of pushing and pulling. If you say something good, you have to say something bad to make the good words shine even brighter. That’s exactly how it is.


“Honestly, it’s so sculpture-like that it actually feels distant.”


“Tell the women of the world to please keep their distance from me.”


“Ah! I can’t stand this. I need to drink something.”


Who in the world doesn’t like being told they’re handsome? Even Chwima drank happily.


“There was a time… … when women really lined up. Can you imagine the Jeongpa Yeohaup and Sapa Yeohaup fighting over me? Oh, I really remember that time.”


Suddenly, as if he had become interested, he jumped up and took off his upper body. Then, without any time to stop him, he jumped into the lake.


He swam around like a madman for a while and then came back up to the pavilion. His body dripping with water had a solid muscular body, but he had many wounds here and there.


Come to think of it, I have never seen the bodies of the demon lords. Perhaps the bodies of other demon lords have these wounds too? Just like the wounds my body was covered in while I was collecting Dafa materials, the wounds required for the position.


“Ah, I’m finally sobering up. Come on, let’s drink some more.”


He came back too well to be called an injection. He put on some clothes and started drinking again.


I drank slowly. He drank nonstop, but he didn’t force me to drink. That was one thing that was really good.


“Shall I be honest and tell you why I called you?”


“Please tell me.”


Then Chwima gave a truly unexpected reason.


“No one is looking for me. Why aren’t you and the Grand Duke looking for me? You meet other demons so easily? Are you ignoring me? Is that so?”


“If that were the case, I wouldn’t have come to see you today.”




“Why? Let’s throw away that nonsense about the main character appearing later.”


“If I had to give a reason, it would be that somehow, Your Majesty seems like someone who is far removed from the succession struggle.”


“I?”


“Isn’t it?”


“Not at all. My liking for alcohol and my struggle to not be pushed out of the school power struggle, what kind of relationship do these two have? Aren’t they completely separate things? What is it? If you like alcohol, you like people, you don’t want power, you don’t have greed. Why should you be like that? Who decided that?”


“I guess this was also a prejudice. You are truly the epitome of prejudice.”


“Oh my, what a noisy world.”


The drunkard drank again. He drank whenever he felt happy or angry or whatever emotion he felt. Drinking like this, it was only natural that he would die from alcoholism.


After a few more drinks, I asked the question I had been holding back.


“Did you send a bottle of alcohol to your brother too?”


“I sent it.”


“Did your brother come looking for you?”


Then Chwima shook his head.


“Instead, they sent this.”


As he reached out, a box in the corner flew over.


When I opened the box, there was a bottle of liquor exactly like the one you sent me. And the bottle was broken.


“Do you know what I thought when I saw this?”


“I know.”


“You know? What was I thinking?”


“What is this kid trying to do?”




When I saw the empty bottle of alcohol that Chwima had sent and repeated what I had said, Chwima drank the alcohol, laughing so hard he thought he would die.


“Lee Gongja is fun. How about we become brothers? It would be really great to have a younger brother as fun as Lee Gongja.”


“I wish my brother was like that too.”


Chwima laughed louder and drank his alcohol.


I felt puzzled.


Since the three Amazons interacted with me, my brother is in a situation where he misses one Amazon. But why did he so blatantly reject Chuma’s offer?


If this is true, we need to find out why my brother made this choice. There must be a reason.


“That’s an unusual reaction for a brother.”


“You may be misunderstanding the Archduke.”


“No one knows my brother better than I do.”


“Hey, Mr. Lee.”


“yes.”


“Do you know that? The people closest to you are the ones who can’t see you.”


He said that it was a nice thing to say, but in the meantime, Chwima spilled his drink. Feeling embarrassed for no reason, he tried to swim again.


“I need to sober up. You cheeky little fish! They probably have a lot of prejudices against me too. I’m going to give them a lesson.”


I stopped him as he staggered to his feet.


“Stop eating. I have to go now.”


Honestly, I wanted to drink more. Was it because I was drunk and had alcohol? Or was it because the sleeping worm inside me woke up? This drinking party was fun.


However, since I was with the person I had to be most careful with in this martial arts world at the drinking party, I was going to end it by just drinking the alcohol I brought.


“I’ll call it a day for today.”




Chwima asked me, leaning against the back of the chair, unable to control his body.


“Are you going to drink with me again?”


“Anytime you call.”


“Shouldn’t we be close friends?”


Instead of answering, I asked him the very question Ian had asked.


“When was the most delicious and enjoyable drink you’ve ever had?”


I think this question is a great one that gives us a glimpse into what kind of person he is.


Then came an unexpected answer.


“now.”


“Are you talking about having a drink with me? It would be an honor.”


“Our scientists have wild dreams.”


Chwima looked at the lake with unfocused eyes.


“I always think the drink I’m drinking right now tastes the best. Whether I’m drinking alone or with a stranger passing by. The drink I’m drinking right now tastes the best. Even if you leave and an assassin comes to kill me, the drink I’m drinking with him will taste the best.”


Then the drunkard emptied his last glass. Now he was so drunk that he leaned back against the backrest as if he was almost lying down and closed his eyes. He motioned for me to go away and made a tongue-lashing sound.


“What memories would there be of the last drink that has already been flushed out? Goodbye.”


With those words he fell asleep.


I turned around quietly and left.


The drunkard who had greeted me earlier, Yeo-bin, was rowing the boat.


When I was halfway across the lake, I looked back.


The horse, unable to control its body, was hanging on the railing of the pavilion like laundry and looking at me.




It was too far away to see his facial expression, but thanks to the Shinan technique, I could see his face clearly. His face was red as if it was going to burst, and his eyes were… … indifferent.


His eyes were so empty that it made me wonder what all the alcohol, jokes, and time had been for.


He was neither as sloppy as Ilhwageomjon felt, nor as unpleasant as Geukaksoma felt. He seemed like a drunkard, but he was not a drunkard, and he looked easygoing, but he was not easygoing.


I still don’t know what kind of person Chwima is.


\* \* \*


After leaving Daechurim, I went straight to find Hyeolcheon Doma.


Blood Heavenly Sword Master was still practicing Taoism today.


“Why are you so absorbed in cultivation these days?”


After thrusting the Heavenly Sword he was swinging into the ground, he leaned against the sword. His body was soaked with sweat.


“You may believe that you can end the fight for succession without shedding blood, but I do not.”


It meant that a bloody fight could break out.


“Will you fight for me?”


“You fight for me.”


“That’s it.”


“You drank alcohol.”


“I had a drink with a drunkard.”


“With a horse?”


“Yes. He approached me first.”


So, what does the bloodthirsty horse think of the drunk horse?


“The drunkard is a wicked man. Don’t get close to him.”


The sinister one. It was the moment when another side of the drunkard was revealed.


“Why do you only hang out with bad people?”


“There has to be a good person somewhere.”


The blood clot was just a taste.


“If you had to choose between the evil Soma and the drunken horse, who would you choose?”


He couldn’t easily choose one person.


“Are you saying it’s that sinister?”


“I hate drunks. They’re different when they’re drunk and different when they’re sober. They’re shameless and oblivious to the truth about injections. Those who are at the extreme of that madness are drunks.”


But that wasn’t the only reason why Hyeolcheon Doma hated drunkenness.


“Have you ever seen him awake?”


“No, there isn’t.”


“Neither have I. Probably no one has seen it. That’s why he’s called a sinister guy.”


The decisive reason why Hyeolcheon Doma hates him has been revealed.


“He never showed himself sober.”


Is his drunken appearance really his real self? Is his waking state his real self?


“Watch out. The sinister one is starting to move.”


I don’t know what made him send me that bottle of alcohol. Maybe, you bastard, it’s finally time for you to sober up for once in your life.
