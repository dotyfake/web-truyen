## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Wicked Granny vừa rời khỏi chỗ ngồi, Cheong-ryeong đã cố gắng hết sức để trốn thoát khỏi nhà tù bằng gỗ bạc (silver wood). Tuy nhiên, do trận pháp bùa chú (talisman formation) và tiếp xúc lâu với gỗ bạc, linh thể của cô đã bị tổn hại nghiêm trọng, năng lượng cạn kiệt. Đúng lúc đó, cột chống giữa nhà rung chuyển dữ dội, một phần bàn bị tách ra, bùa chú rơi xuống, tạo một khe hở nhỏ cho phép cô hồi phục linh khí.

Ngoài nhà, Mok Gyeong-un hét lớn tên Cheong-ryeong. Wicked Granny ngạc nhiên hỏi cậu ta đang làm gì. Mok Gyeong-un định sử dụng Vô hình kiếm (formless sword), nhưng năng lượng xung quanh di chuyển hỗn loạn, gây khó khăn cho việc ngưng tụ chân khí (true qi). Wicked Granny tấn công, buộc Mok Gyeong-un phải né tránh. Destruction Emperor, bị bà ta giữ đầu, đã phản công nhưng bất thành. Wicked Granny chế nhạo hắn vì đã nhận ra kỹ năng của hắn.

Destruction Emperor tìm cách trốn thoát qua một không gian bị bóp méo, nhưng bị Wicked Granny bắt lại và ném xuống đất. Mok Gyeong-un tấn công bà ta để giải cứu Destruction Emperor, nhưng bị đẩy lùi. Wicked Granny tự tin tuyên bố mọi thứ đều nằm trong lòng bàn tay bà ta.

Mok Gyeong-un hỏi về tung tích của "oan hồn" (vengeful spirit) đã vào đây. Wicked Granny đáp rằng oan hồn đó đã phải trả giá cho việc xâm nhập trái phép và đã bị tiêu diệt. Ngay khi bà ta nói xong, một sát khí kinh khủng từ Mok Gyeong-un bùng nổ. Wicked Granny cảm thấy hứng thú, nhưng nhận ra mình không thể rời khỏi trận pháp này.

Đúng lúc đó, một tiếng nổ lớn vang lên, toàn bộ cánh đồng rung chuyển. Bầu trời nứt vỡ. Wicked Granny kinh hoàng nhìn về phía ngôi nhà tranh, nhận ra có vấn đề với cột trụ trung tâm. Hóa ra, Cheong-ryeong, với chút sức lực cuối cùng, đã sử dụng Hư Không Định Thần (Void Stabilizing Breath) trong Bát Tưởng Phá Tâm (Eight Thought-Shattering Techniques) vào cột trụ. Một phần cột trụ bị hút vào không gian, gây ra dị thường cho toàn bộ trận pháp. Wicked Granny vội vàng buông cây trượng và lao về phía Vô hình kiếm (formless sword) đang bay tới.

 Chapter 443 – Wicked Heart Granny (2)


 Sizzle!


 -Urgh.


 From the moment Wicked Granny left her seat, Cheong-ryeong had been straining with all her might to somehow escape from this prison made of silver wood.


 However, due to the talisman formation and prolonged exposure to the silver wood, her spirit body had taken too much damage.


 Her spirit energy was almost completely depleted, and she had now reached a dangerous state.


 -Haa… Haa…


 This was the only chance to escape from that old monster’s hands, but what could she do?


 She hadn’t given up, but if she tried to forcibly break the silver wood again, she might truly reach the worst-case scenario.


 It was at that moment.


 -Bang! Rumble!


 Once again, the pillar supporting the center of the thatched house shook violently, and along with it, everything inside the house trembled as if an earthquake had struck.


 Then,


 

 -Crack!


 Part of the table split, and the talismans attached to it were torn off.


 With this, a tiny gap formed in the energy that had completely blocked her from the outside, preventing her from recovering spirit energy.


 -Swish swish!


 Because of this, Cheong-ryeong could feel a little spirit energy seeping into her burning spirit body.


 -Ah!


 Though it was faint, the difference between recovering spirit energy and not was significant.


 Her face, which had been becoming increasingly transparent, began to regain some color.


 It was at this moment.


 -Blue Spiriiiiiit!!!!


 ‘!?’


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c4f98310f240f4d43d687", id: "pf-8947-1"}) At the resounding voice, her eyes reddened.


 She had tried so hard to cut off her emotions and erase all traces to prevent him from following her, yet how did he come all the way here?


 ‘Mortal…’


 \*\*\*


 Wicked Granny could intuitively be certain.


 The skill to wield even a formless sword, which could be considered the pinnacle of swordsmanship.


 And an energy on par with her own.


 This fellow was undoubtedly the pinnacle of the current martial arts world.


 Wicked Granny’s lips, which had been displeased due to the intruder causing a disturbance just moments ago, twitched and burned with a competitive spirit.


 Finally, she opened her mouth towards the intruder, that is, Mok Gyeong-un.


 “You… The current martial arts world’s…”


 Before she could finish speaking.


 Mok Gyeong-un took a deep breath and then shouted in a voice so loud it resonated throughout the vast meadow.


 “Cheong-ryeong!!!”


 At this cry from Mok Gyeong-un, Wicked Granny, who had been showing a competitive spirit, raised one eyebrow in puzzlement.


 “Cheong-ryeong?”


 What is that, shouting it so suddenly?


 As she wondered, she saw Mok Gyeong-un, who had shouted at the top of his lungs enough to make her eardrums ring, looking towards the thatched house.


 At this, Wicked Granny snorted and said.


 “Before being the pinnacle of the current martial arts world, you’re a strange one. What is this Cheong-ryeong that you’re shouting about so loudly?”


 At this question, Mok Gyeong-un gripped his sword-controlling finger and extended it towards her.


 Though it was his first time seeing her, from the moment he saw her, he had instinctively known she was no ordinary enemy due to her extraordinary aura.


 Therefore, he judged that he needed to give it his all from the start.


 So he tried to summon a formless sword, but,


 -Woong woong!


 A glint appeared in Mok Gyeong-un’s eyes.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c50524a5a770dd7e4e350", id: "pf-8948-1"}) And for good reason,


 ‘The energy is moving on its own.’


 Mok Gyeong-un, who had surpassed the wall of walls, could be said to have reached the highest realm in handling true qi.


 But because the surrounding energies were moving so fluidly, it was difficult to condense true qi.


 It was at that moment.


 -Bang!


 Mok Gyeong-un hurriedly stepped half a step to the side, stimulated by the energy sensing danger.


 Then, an invisible intense energy brushed past where he had been standing, and the grass in the meadow parted left and right as the air shook.


 Seeing this, Mok Gyeong-un turned his head again to look at Wicked Granny.


 He saw her pointing her staff towards him.


 “Kekeke. Good. Incompetent ones wouldn’t have even been able to avoid that.”


 “Who are you?”


 “Well. That’s not something you should be asking me, having barged into someone else’s dwelling…”


 -Thud!


 Before Wicked Granny could finish speaking.


 At that moment, Destruction Emperor, whose head was gripped in her hand, grabbed her wrist and launched a kick towards her face.


 Of course, she easily avoided it by tilting her head slightly to the side.

 Then she tried to inflict more pain by gripping Destruction Emperor’s head harder, but,


 -Whoosh!


 At that instant, Wicked Granny’s body flipped upside down and shot upwards due to a strange force.


 Because of this, Destruction Emperor’s head slipped from her grasp.


 Not missing this chance, Destruction Emperor hurriedly created distance.


 -Tap tap tap tap!


 Destruction Emperor’s complexion didn’t look good as he distanced himself.


 He had succeeded in detaching himself from this unidentified woman through direct contact, but the demonic energy in his body was moving erratically and hard to control.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) It was difficult to understand what kind of phenomenon this was.


 Meanwhile,


 -Tap!


 Wicked Granny, who had been flipped upside down, lightly somersaulted and landed on the ground.


 She looked at Destruction Emperor with interest and said.


 “Oh? You have quite an interesting skill. I’ve experienced techniques like the Thousand Jin Hammer, but to make my body light as a feather…”


 At these words, Destruction Emperor’s gaze sharpened.


 It was because the opponent had roughly figured out what kind of ability his technique possessed.


 Destruction Emperor’s mind became complicated.


 Although he had forcibly entered this place, he hadn’t expected such a monstrous being to be here.


 It was better to avoid a direct confrontation with such a person in a situation where the energy in his body was moving erratically.


 -Swish!


 Destruction Emperor’s eyes moved back and forth.


 Then he spotted a distorted space in the air.


 It was the part where the formation hadn’t recovered due to Mok Gyeong-un’s formless sword.


 ‘I need to get out.’


 As Destruction Emperor tried to fly towards that place,


 -Swoosh!


 At that moment, a faint shadow shot up, grabbed his face, and slammed him down towards the ground.


 -Bang!


 “Gah!”


 “Where do you think you’re going? Everything you’ve seen…”


 -Swish!


 At that moment, Wicked Granny, sensing a sharp blade flying towards her, raised her staff and swept it.


 -Clang!


 The blade was split in half and scattered in the air.


 The one who had launched it was none other than Mok Gyeong-un.


 Wicked Granny raised the corner of her mouth in a sneer and said.


 “Were you allies with this fellow?”


 “No.”


 “Then why are you interfering with my…”


 -Woong woong woong!


 -Flinch!


 At that moment, Wicked Granny hurriedly threw Destruction Emperor, whose face she had been gripping, backwards due to a strange force pulling at her abdomen.


 -Thud! Crash bang bang!


 Destruction Emperor, thrown backwards, rolled several times before finally regaining his balance.


 A blue energy that looked like true qi could be seen gathered into a fist-sized sphere in his right palm.


 -Crackle! Crackle!


 The space around the sphere was bending.


 However, because the energy forming it was moving so erratically, Destruction Emperor couldn’t maintain it to the end.


 Eventually, the sphere simply dissipated.


 ‘Damn it!’


 Watching this, Wicked Granny smirked and said.


 “Well, well. You’re neither human nor spiritual beast, but such a being. That’s why you’ve learned such an unusual technique.”


 At these words, Destruction Emperor’s pupils shook.


 It was the same inside this strange formation, but this woman was truly dangerous.


 She was uncovering a lot just from exchanging a few moves with him.


 As he was bewildered,


 “Where do you think you’re going!”


 At that moment, Wicked Granny twisted her body and extended her ringed staff towards someone.


 An enormous gust of wind swept through, and because of this, Mok Gyeong-un, who had been trying to run towards the thatched house, had to fly backwards to avoid it.


 Mok Gyeong-un, who had to distance himself nearly thirty paces before escaping it, exhaled lightly and looked at Wicked Granny.


 “Kekeke. I suppose you thought the enemy of my enemy is my friend and tried to gain some advantage by helping this fellow, but it’s useless. Child. You’re all in the palm of my hand.”


 At her cry, Mok Gyeong-un’s eyes narrowed.


 It seemed that the only one who could move freely in this space was that unidentified woman.


 Not only was the energy in his body moving erratically, but even the surrounding energies were moving without regularity, making it impossible to release true qi externally.


 Yet she was freely doing so.


 Regardless of her original martial prowess, within this space, she was practically invincible.


 At this, Mok Gyeong-un became cautious and spoke.


 “What did you do with the vengeful spirit that entered here?”


 ‘Vengeful spirit?’


 At Mok Gyeong-un’s question, curiosity filled Wicked Granny’s eyes.


 Unlike this being who was neither human nor spiritual beast, this fellow’s eyes had been focused on something else other than this place from the start.


 Recently, all the intruders had been causing a commotion demanding the forbidden technique to handle souls, but this fellow was showing interest in a mere vengeful spirit.


 Intrigued by this, she opened her mouth.


 “Ah. You must be talking about that arrogant vengeful spirit with the completely red appearance.”


 “What did you do to her?”


 To this question, Wicked Granny shrugged her shoulders and answered glibly.


 “What should I do? That vengeful spirit you’re looking for paid the price for entering this place uninvited.”


 “Price…?”


 “There’s no point in desperately searching here for a vengeful spirit that’s already been annihilated…”


 -Whoosh!


 -Flinch!


 At that moment, Wicked Granny couldn’t continue her words.


 As soon as she said the vengeful spirit had been annihilated, a ferocious and terribly intense killing intent from him pressed down on all directions.


 A glint appeared in her eyes.


 She had seen countless individuals over the years, but this was the first time she had encountered such a primordial and overwhelming killing intent.


 ‘This is something else.’


 It was enough to make her whole body break out in goosebumps.


 Usually, those who have reached such a level have deep cultivation and don’t lose their reason even when angered, knowing how to control themselves.


 But from this fellow, a completely raw scent was emanating.


 ‘Yes. This is it.’


 It’s a sensation she hadn’t felt in a long time.


 Living here with the thought of repaying her karma, she had almost forgotten those blood-soaked days.


 But encountering this killing intent that seemed to pierce her lungs, she longed for those times again.


 Indeed, no matter how many years one trains, is it impossible to change this unique temperament?


 ‘Ah, what a shame.’


 She would have liked to properly face him outside the formation and taste his skill, but being in a position where she couldn’t leave this place, that seemed impossible.


 But if it was someone who had surpassed the wall of walls, even if he couldn’t properly handle energy, wouldn’t he be able to entertain her to some extent?


 As she was about to face Mok Gyeong-un, who was emanating tremendous killing intent towards her,


 -Boom!


 It was at that very moment.


 Along with a thunderous sound, the entire meadow shook violently as if an earthquake had struck.


 It wasn’t just the ground.


 The blue sky rippled and cracks began to form in all directions.


 At this, Wicked Granny glared at the thatched house with a terribly distorted expression.


 ‘No way?’


 It couldn’t be.


 Surely that vengeful spirit woman was trapped in the silver wood prison and couldn’t do anything.


 But why had an anomaly occurred in the entire formation?


 

  This could only happen if there was a problem with the pillar that could be called the center…


 It was at that moment.


 -Woong! Swish!


 ‘Oh no!’


 At that instant, Wicked Granny hurriedly dropped the staff she was holding and stretched out her hand towards the formless sword flying at her like lightning.


 \*\*\*


 -Haa… Haa…


 Cheong-ryeong, having almost completely depleted her spirit energy, was pointing her index finger towards the pillar with an extremely faint spirit body.


 The Void Stabilizing Breath[1] of the Eight Thought-Shattering Techniques, which she had used on the off chance it might work.


 It was a supreme technique that transcended simple laws, and she had used it with the sole thought of somehow helping Mok Gyeong-un, and that slim chance had worked.


 -Aah!


 Although it was the Void Stabilizing Breath performed with diminished and weakened spirit energy, part of the pillar was sucked into space and fell off, causing an anomaly in the formation.
