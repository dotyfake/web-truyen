 Chapter 111 – The Final Gate (2)


 The Bright Blade King Son Yun remembered Mok Gyeong-un as clearly being at a mere third-rate level.


 Of course, that didn’t mean he considered him insignificant.


 Mok Gyeong-un had learned the sword techniques of the Moon Vein, which had been lost a hundred years ago, and also possessed innate talent in sorcery.


New novel 𝓬hapters are published on freёwebnoѵel.com.

 Therefore, although Mok Gyeong-un was from the orthodox Yeon Mok Sword Manor, Son Yun had brought him to the Heaven and Earth Society.


 It was not only important to draw out the Moon Sword Technique within his mind, but Mok Gyeong-un, who had been chosen by the secret manuals, could possibly become a talent of the Heaven and Earth Society.


 However, he thought all of that had been ruined due to the whim of the Heaven and Earth Society’s Leader.


 [Send him to Corpse Blood Valley?]


 [It’s the Society Leader’s order. Do you intend to disobey?]


 [But…]


 [Tsk-tsk.]


 He couldn’t understand the reason.


 Why did the Society Leader order the two hostages from Yeon Mok Sword Manor to be sent to Corpse Blood Valley?


 

 He didn’t even meet them face-to-face.


 The Bright Blade King Son Yun abandoned any lingering attachment to Mok Gyeong-un because of that.


 Even if he had learned the Moon Sword Technique, the place he was being sent to was Corpse Blood Valley.


 A place where more than 80% of those who enter come out as corpses.


 How could a mere third-rate novice survive in that place teeming with trainees possessing first-rate qualifications or higher?


 ‘It’s over.’


 Would the Moon Sword Technique be completely lost like this?


 While he was feeling disappointed, yesterday, he couldn’t hide his shock due to his disciple’s honest report.


 [What? Say it again.]


 [Uh, it’s not that I completely lost. I let my guard down, and…]


 [No! The fellow’s name.]


 [M…Mok Gyeong-un.]


 ‘!!!!!!’


 Mok Gyeong-un.


 That boy was alive?


 A mere third-rate fellow was sent to Corpse Blood Valley?


 If it had been the youngest of the Yeon Mok Sword Manor hostages, Mok Yu-cheon, he would have understood.


 He had acknowledged Mok Yu-cheon’s innate qualifications to that extent.


 But Mok Gyeong-un had survived until now…


 [Haa… How could this happen…]


 [Master?]


 [Shut your mouth.]


 The day before yesterday, he had received a message requesting his attendance at the final gate and final ceremony.


 But the fellow had not only reached the final gate but had also obtained the top disciple placard by winning against Yeop Wi-seon in the hidden treasure vault?


 Even for him, who didn’t bat an eye at most things, he couldn’t help but be surprised by this.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c4f98310f240f4d43d687", id: "pf-8947-1"}) At this, the Bright Blade King Son Yun fell into deep contemplation last night.


 What on earth had happened in Corpse Blood Valley?


 How could Mok Gyeong-un, who was merely a third-rate, become so strong in such a short time that he could defeat his youngest disciple Yeop Wi-seon, who had reached the Transcendent Realm?


 Various questions overlapped.


 However, without seeing it directly, there was no way to resolve these questions satisfactorily.


 Therefore, Son Yun made a decision.


 ‘Let’s confirm it myself.’


 He already had five outstanding disciples known as the Five Tigers, the top talents within the Heaven and Earth Society, including his chief disciple Woo Ho-rang.


 Thus, he had no desire to accept any more disciples.


 However, he decided to step forward to verify Mok Gyeong-un’s unusually rapid progress.


 ‘If…’


 If Mok Gyeong-un demonstrates extraordinary qualifications surpassing his expectations upon seeing him, he had thoughts of accepting him as a disciple even if it meant being scolded by other executives.


 He was a successor who had learned the Moon Sword Technique and survived despite being sent to Corpse Blood Valley by the Society Leader’s whim.


 He couldn’t miss this opportunity.


 Having finished his momentary recollection, the Bright Blade King Son Yun looked at Mok Gyeong-un, one of the six standing side by side in the plaza.


 ‘!?’


 Son Yun slightly furrowed his brows.


 It was difficult to give a definite answer due to the distance, but based on his energy perception, Mok Gyeong-un’s level seemed to have reached the end of the first-rate.


 ‘What is this?’


 Of course, even this could be considered remarkable.


 In a short time, he had progressed from the third-rate to the end of the first-rate.


 However, at that level, it would be difficult to defeat his youngest disciple Yeop Wi-seon.


 ‘The gap between the Peak Realm and Transcendent Realm is distinct.’


 Even if there were ten Peak Realm masters, it would be difficult to defeat a Transcendent Realm supreme master.


 But by what means did Mok Gyeong-un defeat Yeop Wi-seon?


 It was incomprehensible.


 ‘What technique did he use?’


 As he was intently staring at Mok Gyeong-un, his eyes flickered with interest.


 It was because he had discovered not only Mok Gyeong-un but also Mok Yu-cheon.


 ‘That child also survived?’


 It was truly surprising.


 As a result, both of the Yeon Mok Sword Manor’s hostage children had survived.


 Of course, he had thought that Mok Yu-cheon, who possessed innate martial talent unfitting for his age, might survive if he was lucky.


 But to think he had really survived…


 And even entered the top six while overcoming the numerous talents belonging to the Heaven and Earth Society.


 ‘Yeon Mok Sword Manor… It wasn’t a place to be underestimated.’


 It was really unexpected.


 On the other hand, seeing the changed gaze in Mok Yu-cheon’s eyes, he was pleased.


 When he saw Mok Gyeong-un, he was surprised by the advancement in his martial arts, but his expression and gaze were no different from before. In contrast, Mok Yu-cheon seemed to have become quite sturdy, and a murderous intent was even visible.


 It was as if he had shed the shell of a gentle orthodox sect person after surviving Corpse Blood Valley.


 ‘Coming here was the right choice.’


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c50524a5a770dd7e4e350", id: "pf-8948-1"}) It had become interesting.


 One fellow surprised him with his tremendous progress, and the other fellow surprised him with his transformation from back then.


 To think the fellows from an orthodox sect, not those from the Heaven and Earth Society, would capture his interest…


 It was truly a sight to behold after living a long life.


 \*\*\*


 ‘It’s regrettable.’


 Mok Gyeong-un clicked his tongue as he looked towards the front of the stage.


 That woman called the Summoning Sound Valley Master had appeared, and it seemed like something interesting was about to unfold, but it was thwarted midway.


 By the appearance of the Bright Blade King Son Yun.


 -Tsk-tsk.


 Cheong-ryeong clicked her tongue at Mok Gyeong-un.


 -There’s no opponent as troublesome as a master of sound techniques. Unlike other martial arts, sound techniques take a completely different path, so there are no allies or enemies.


 What did that mean?


 While he was puzzled, she spoke as if reading Mok Gyeong-un’s thoughts.


 -It means it’s impossible to target a specific person with sound techniques.


 ‘A specific person? Ah…’


 Indeed, the concept of sound techniques itself was to infuse true energy into sound and create shock waves.


 However, sound isn’t something that only certain people can hear or not hear.


 Unless one is deaf, they have no choice but to hear it in some way.


 He seemed to understand why Cheong-ryeong said those words.


 ‘If that woman unleashes her sound techniques with determination, it will damage the entire surroundings.’


 In that case, there would be an incident even before the final gate could be held.


 However, this made Mok Gyeong-un curious.


 Why would someone learn a martial art that indiscriminately harms both allies and enemies with such a risk?


 ‘If sound techniques are the only focus, it’s inefficient.’


 It might be effective against a large number of opponents, but if there are many people around, the risk is too great.


 But he didn’t think that was all there was to it.


 Even he, who had only been exposed to martial arts for a short time, could think of these shortcomings, so there was no way a specialist in sound techniques would be unaware of them.


 Anyway, the interesting spectacle had disappeared, and an unexpected person had appeared.


 The Bright Blade King Son Yun.


 The very person responsible for bringing him to the Heaven and Earth Society.


 He could see Son Yun staring intently at him.


 Judging from his gaze, which didn’t particularly show emotions of anger or joy, it seemed closer to trying to confirm something.


 ‘Could it be that he came to see me?’


 If that was the case, it was quite unexpected… Ah!


 Mok Gyeong-un suddenly recalled the incident in the Corpse Blood Valley treasure vault.


 Yeop Wi-seon, the disciple of the Bright Blade King Son Yun.


 ‘It’s that fellow.’


 He only found out his identity after fighting him.


 It seemed that Yeop Wi-seon had reported to his master about Mok Gyeong-un.


 Otherwise, there was no way he would appear and stare at him out of nowhere.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) The puzzling point here was,


 ‘Is he not angry?’


 If he had come out of anger after his disciple was harmed, his gaze should have shown rage or something similar, but it didn’t.


 In that case, it seemed there was no need for great concern.


 Rather,


 ‘Is it not time yet?’


 Mok Gyeong-un was waiting for someone.


 The one he was waiting for was none other than Annihilating Poison King Baek Sa-ha, one of the Five Kings.


 According to Corpse Blood Valley Leader Lee Ji-yeom, Annihilating Poison King Baek Sa-ha participated in the final ceremony almost every time, so there would be an opportunity.


 But there was no sign of him appearing yet.


 ‘Hmm.’


 What if a variable arises? That would be quite troublesome.


 The most ideal situation right now was to pass the final gate as the top disciple and gain the right to choose.


 The top disciple of the final gate is granted the right to choose an executive at the final ceremony.


 Of course, whether they would be accepted as a disciple or subordinate depended on the executive’s choice, but at least it would provide an opportunity to be close to them.


 However, for some reason, he had a bad feeling.


 ‘If a situation arises where he doesn’t come…’


 Mok Gyeong-un’s gaze turned towards the executives sitting on chairs next to the stage.


 According to Lee Ji-yeom, the middle-aged man wearing iron rings would be the Thunderbolt Fist King Won Byeong-hak, the one next to him would be the Summoning Sound Valley Master Hang Yeo-ryang, and the one next to her…


 ‘Was he called the Shadow Clan Master?’


 It was quite unexpected.


 According to Lee Ji-yeom’s words, the Shadow Clan Master and the Summoning Sound Valley Master had rarely attended the final ceremony, and given their dispositions, the probability of them not coming this time was high.


 But the ones who were said to be unlikely to attend had come to the final ceremony.


 Among the expected individuals, the only one who matched was the Thunderbolt Fist King Won Byeong-hak.


 

 ‘Hmm.’


 Mok Gyeong-un stroked his chin.


 The final gate was about to begin soon, but at this rate, there seemed to be no way to become the disciple of Annihilating Poison King Baek Sa-ha.


 ‘Should I go with the alternative?’


 Mok Gyeong-un had the benefit of obtaining three top disciple placards.


 [Apart from the final gate, you can request teachings from one of the twelve elders, including the Five Kings, Three Chief Masters, and Four Valley Masters, who can be considered the top masters of this sect.]


 Originally, he had intended to use this benefit to learn from one of the Five Kings who had received the title of Eight Stars, known as the top masters in the Central Plains, as suggested by Corpse Blood Valley Leader Lee Ji-yeom.


 Cheong-ryeong had also agreed with this.


 [An opportunity to receive teachings from a Transformation Realm true grandmaster won’t come easily.]


 Mok Gyeong-un also thought there was truth to those words.


 Cheong-ryeong always told Mok Gyeong-un.


 There was no need to be fixated on one thing, and one should have a broad scope of thinking.


 Martial arts could also provide an opportunity to broaden one’s thinking by listening to the views of various masters.


 ‘But I might not be able to do that.’


 If Annihilating Poison King Baek Sa-ha doesn’t show up at the final ceremony, he would have to use this benefit.


 Only then could he inquire about the Ghost Blade from him.


 \*\*\*


 About two hours passed.


 The only ones who appeared before the start of the final gate were Bo Hyuk-so, the Grand Elder of the Flame Demon Clan, which was ranked fifth among the hundred martial clans of the Heaven and Earth Society, and Dae So-man, the Elder of the Scarlet Blood Clan, which was ranked seventh.


 Among the hundred clans, the elders of the clans ranked within the top ten were given the title of Grand Elder.


 Their treatment could be considered equivalent to that of a quasi-executive.


 ‘No choice.’


 Mok Gyeong-un clicked his tongue as if he was disappointed.


 In the end, he had to choose among the Bright Blade King Son Yun, Thunderbolt Fist King Won Byeong-hak, Shadow Clan Master, Summoning Sound Valley Master Hang Yeo-ryang, Flame Demon Clan’s Grand Elder Bo Hyuk-so, and Scarlet Blood Clan’s Elder Dae So-man.


 Of course, this was under the assumption that he would pass the final gate as the top disciple.


 Corpse Blood Valley Leader Lee Ji-yeom stepped onto the stage and opened his mouth.


 “Now that all the observers have gathered, we will commence the final gate.”


 Lee Ji-yeom lightly flicked his finger.


 Then, warriors in red belts brought a large wooden board and placed it right next to the stage.


 It had several lines drawn horizontally and vertically, with blanks left in various places.


 Seeing this, the trainees’ eyes narrowed.


 ‘A tournament bracket?’


 It seemed to be a tournament bracket.


 If names were filled in the blank spaces, it would form a perfect tournament bracket.


 In other words,


 “To clarify, this is a tournament bracket for sparring.”


 ‘Ah…’


 The final gate was revealed.


 It was none other than sparring.


 Unlike the previous ones, it was the most primitive method of testing.


 “The trainees have tested their own limits through various gates until now, and as a result, they stand here. And the final gate is now an opportunity to showcase your potential to the observers.”


 Martial arts competition.


 Through this, they would have the chance to display their respective martial arts.


 How much they showed here would determine the range of choices available to them.


 ‘Sparring…’


 The trainees’ eyes became serious.


 Unlike before, they had to prove their skills in front of the executives.


 It was only natural for them to feel nervous and have exceptional motivation.


 However, there was one problem here.


 ‘The number doesn’t match.’


 The number of trainees was six.


 If they were to have matches, eight would be the most ideal number.


 That way, eight would compete, then four, and then two, allowing them to determine the final winner.


 But since there were six, inevitably…


 ‘Advancement without a match.’


 Advancement without a match.


 In other words, two people could reach the final match with just one bout.


 At that moment, the senior warrior Gwak Mun-gi went to the tournament bracket and began writing numbers.


 一, 二, 三, 四, 五, 六.


 Among them, the ones who drew 五 (five) and 六 (six) could reach the final match with just one bout.


 Then, Corpse Blood Valley Leader Lee Ji-yeom pointed to a table placed in front of the stage.


 On it was a wooden box with circular holes on top.


 “As you can see, since the number doesn’t match, we will draw lots to determine the tournament bracket…”


 Suk!


 Then, someone raised their hand.


 It was Yeon Mu-ung from the Esoteric Realm Gate.


 Unlike the previous gates, this was the final gate, and the executives were watching, so he stepped forward without hesitation.


 “May I ask one question?”


 “Speak.”


 “Those who advance without a match and those who advance after two bouts will be at a disadvantage in terms of stamina and everything else. Will it be valid?”


 Everyone nodded in agreement with these words.


 Then, Corpse Blood Valley Leader Lee Ji-yeom smirked and soon spoke.


 “Naturally, it will be difficult for those who have to fight two bouts to manage their stamina, so they will certainly be given sufficient time to circulate energy and recover. And the final match to determine the winner will only be a contest of techniques without internal energy.”


 Yeon Mu-ung from the Esoteric Realm Gate lowered his hand, seemingly somewhat convinced by his words.


 If they were to suffer injuries, the story would be different, but it seemed like an attempt to eliminate the disadvantageous conditions to some extent.


 At this time, Mok Gyeong-un muttered softly.


 “Couldn’t we all just fight at once?”


 “Tsk-tsk.”


 At these words, Mok Yu-cheon, who was right next to him, openly clicked his tongue.


 If that were to happen, who would everyone here consider as the first target to deal with?


 It would be none other than Mok Gyeong-un.


 In a group match, they would try to eliminate the most dangerous opponent first, so it wouldn’t be a fair match.


 Of course, Mok Yu-cheon still didn’t know.


 The fact that two out of the six were Mok Gyeong-un’s subordinates.


 Then, Corpse Blood Valley Leader Lee Ji-yeom continued speaking.


 “Now, the trainees will come forward in order and draw the metal balls inside the wooden box.”


 The time for the drawing had come.


 The first opportunity to choose was given to those who had the lowest scores in the previous gate.


 They were Mok Yu-cheon and Yeon Mu-ung from the Esoteric Realm Gate.


 Perhaps because he was afraid of being told he had the lowest score if he went first, Yeon Mu-ung didn’t step forward right away.


 So Mok Yu-cheon was the first to draw a metal ball from inside the wooden box.


 Mok Yu-cheon’s number was,


 “Six (六).”


 At these words, Yeon Mu-ung from the Esoteric Realm Gate showed a slightly disappointed expression.


 No matter how fair they tried to make it, the advantage of being able to fight for the championship with just one match as 五 (five) and 六 (six) was inevitable.


 ‘Haa…’


 Mok Yu-cheon looked at the six he had drawn and scoffed.


 Should this be considered good luck?


 While he was doing that, Yeon Mu-ung drew a number tag.


 It was,


 “…Four (四).”


 Unfortunately, the advancement without a match had flown away.


 It was disappointing, but there was no other choice.


 Next, Mo Ha-rang from the Demon Fire Hall came forward and drew a metal ball.


 “Three (三).”


 ‘!?’


 At those words, the corners of Yeon Mu-ung’s mouth twitched.


 She was an opponent he had wanted to face at least once, as they had always been compared in this Corpse Blood Valley gate.


 Next, Mu Jang-yak walked forward.


 Mu Jang-yak didn’t mind either way.


 After all, while winning was important in this gate, it was also an opportunity to showcase one’s talent to the observers.


 Tak!


 “One (一).”


 The number Mu Jang-yak drew was one.


 Next, Yeom Ga from the Vermillion Slaughter Cave walked forward.


 The Demonic Monk possessing Yeom Ga had no particular thoughts about this drawing, so he expressionlessly put his hand in and drew a metal ball.


 The number was,


 “Five (五).”


 At those words, the expressions of two people changed.


 Mok Yu-cheon, who already thought he owed a debt to Yeom Ga from the Vermillion Slaughter Cave, showed a delighted expression as Yeom Ga became his opponent in the bracket.


 And the other person was none other than Mu Jang-yak.


 Naturally, without even drawing lots, he sighed as he looked at Mok Gyeong-un, who had become his opponent.


 ‘It ended up like this.’


 He had thought the day would come when he would directly face Mok Gyeong-un.


 But it had already arrived.


 ‘The first match against the most difficult opponent…’


 Mu Jang-yak shook his head back and forth.


 The person he had considered as someone who would be troublesome if he became an enemy among his peers was none other than Mok Gyeong-un.


 But to think they would face each other like this.


 Kwak!


 His fists naturally clenched.


 It wasn’t particularly out of fear.


 

  He didn’t think he would lose right away.


 He had a secret technique that no one could defeat, after all.


 This elevated sensation was simply overconfidence.


 Mu Jang-yak approached Mok Gyeong-un and spoke while extending his hand.


 “We ended up facing each other like this. Regardless of who wins, let’s do our best.”


 At these words, Mok Gyeong-un grabbed his hand and spoke as if it was troublesome.


 “Uh. That seems difficult.”


 “What?”


 “If I do my best, the match will become too boring, so I’ll go easy on you. So you do your best.”


 ‘!?’


 What nonsense was this guy spouting?


 Was he provoking him now?
