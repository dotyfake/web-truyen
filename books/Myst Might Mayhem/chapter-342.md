 Chapter 342 – To Offer (3)


 It was something no one had anticipated.


 For a moment, the hall fell into silence at the sight of the Deputy Clan Leader Tang Cheol-yong’s head being torn off along with his spine.


 Although injuries and deaths were commonplace in the martial arts world, there was at least a line that shouldn’t be crossed.


 Most people couldn’t hide their shock at the cruel act that was too gruesome to witness with open eyes, and some even began vomiting, unable to endure it.


 “Ah… Ahh…”


 “Bleurgh!”


 “This… this cruelty!”


 The silence caused by the shock was broken, but the surroundings were in turmoil.


 Seeing their reaction, Mok Gyeong-un smiled and swung Tang Cheol-yong’s head, which had been ripped off along with his spine, like a toy, saying,


 “You have weak stomachs, it seems. Vomiting at just this much.”


 Speaking as if he had no emotion, the Tang Clan warriors couldn’t help but click their tongues.


 How could he do this while wearing a human mask?


 

 At that moment, a Tang Clan warrior couldn’t hold back and stepped forward, shouting,


 “Stop this at once! I don’t know what grudge you have against our clan, but how can you do this as a human being…”


 -Swish!


 ‘…Huh?’


 At that moment, the Tang Clan warrior couldn’t finish his sentence.


 Mok Gyeong-un, who had been in front of him, had suddenly disappeared, and he felt a touch on his shoulder.


 “Why did you stop speaking? Please continue.”


 It was said that it was difficult to even breathe when under extreme tension.


 The Tang Clan warrior’s breathing became rough, and he couldn’t utter a single word.


 The hand on his shoulder playfully moved towards his neck, and the image of Deputy Clan Leader Tang Cheol-yong’s neck being ripped off repeatedly flashed in his mind.


 ‘I… I’m going to die.’


 As fear of death gripped him, his face gradually turned ashen.

 “You’re wasting the courage you mustered.”


 Mok Gyeong-un’s hand, shrugging his shoulders, soon reached for the warrior’s neck.


 -Whoosh!


 At that moment, someone leaped behind Mok Gyeong-un to launch a sneak attack.


 It was Tang Su-woo, one of the Tang Clan’s executives and a supreme master of the transcendent realm, ranked among the top five within the clan.


 Knowing that he couldn’t do anything in a direct confrontation against this monster, he had been waiting for an opportunity to arise.


 By chance, Mok Gyeong-un had approached within just eight steps.


 He couldn’t miss this opportunity.


 ‘Die!’


 Suppressing his presence to the maximum, Tang Su-woo unleashed his most powerful poisonous art technique.


 ‘Absolute Poison Eight Palms 7th Stance: Rising Domineering Poison Flash!’


 The Sichuan Tang Clan had a poisonous martial art known as the Four Great Poison Techniques.


 One of them was the Absolute Poison Eight Palms, and the last three stances were high-level techniques that could instantly subdue and kill the opponent.


 -Swish swish swish!


 Tang Su-woo’s hands swiftly targeted the vital acupuncture points on Mok Gyeong-un’s back, accompanied by afterimages.


 Even when his hands were about to make contact, Mok Gyeong-un showed no signs of noticing.


 Could he really kill a supreme master comparable to the Six Heavens with his own hands?


 -Grab!


 “Ack!”


 Tang Su-woo’s eyes wavered.


 Mok Gyeong-un was already looking at him and grasping his neck.


 ‘Wh-When?’


 He was utterly bewildered.


 He was so fast that Tang Su-woo couldn’t even perceive his movements.


 Was this the realm of extreme speed movement that only those who had reached the realm of lightness skill could achieve?


 ‘I need to break free first.’


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c50524a5a770dd7e4e350", id: "pf-8948-1"}) He was in the midst of unleashing a sweeping strike, so regardless of his neck being grabbed, he just needed to continue…


 -Grip!


 “Ugh ugh.”


 Coincidentally, the moment his neck was grabbed, like everyone else, the imprint left by Deputy Clan Leader Tang Cheol-yong’s death made him prioritize breaking free.


 “Let… let go!”


 However…


 “You’re a nuisance.”


 “What…”


 -Slice!


 “Ack!”


 Mok Gyeong-un severed Tang Su-woo’s right arm, which was trying to break free, with a sword hand strike imbued with predestined energy.


 The same happened to his other left arm.


 -Slice!


 Tang Su-woo, with both arms severed, couldn’t endure the pain and screamed like a madman.


 “Aaaaargh!”


 -Thud!


 However, his scream didn’t last long.


 Mok Gyeong-un tightly grasped his neck, rendering him unable to scream.


 “Urgh…”


 “Why did you act recklessly when your turn would have come soon even without making a fuss?”


 -Crunch!


 At that moment, Tang Su-woo’s neck, grasped by Mok Gyeong-un’s hand, was torn off, and his head rolled on the ground.

 Blood gushed like a fountain from his headless body, drenching Mok Gyeong-un’s hair and face.


 Mok Gyeong-un swept back his blood-soaked hair and licked his lips with his tongue.


 -Slurp!


 Did he find the taste of blood enjoyable?


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) The corners of Mok Gyeong-un’s mouth curled up.


 His appearance was so chilling that the Tang Clan warriors, who had mustered some courage, turned pale and lost their words.


 Some couldn’t even breathe properly due to the immense fear.


 As he gazed at them one by one, they all lowered their heads, unable to make eye contact.


 Mok Gyeong-un’s overwhelming pressure had reached its peak.


 “It seems no one else has the courage to step forward. Then, since doing it one by one might take all night, should I reduce the headcount a bit?”


 -Swish!


 Mok Gyeong-un grasped his sword fingers and raised his arm, causing everyone to be puzzled.


 It was at that very moment.


 -Rumble!


 A vicious energy arose from his sword fingers, and a black sword energy formed the shape of a sword.


 The length of the sword energy instantly soared to nearly four jang, and the eyes of the Tang Clan warriors trembled like crazy upon seeing it.


 ‘Impossible!’


 ‘Wh-What kind of energy is that?’


 They were all martial artists, so they possessed energy perception.


 Their shock stemmed from the fact that the energy flowing from that black sword was enough to astound the heavens and shake the earth.


 How many among those present could block or withstand that sword energy?


 

 Just a single swing of it would claim the lives of countless Tang Clan warriors.


 “Then, starting from the east side…”


 “Stooooop!!!!!”


 The moment Mok Gyeong-un was about to swing the sword energy, Tang Clan Leader Tang In-hae shouted at the top of his lungs.


 Thanks to that, everyone’s attention was momentarily drawn to him.


 Of course, Mok Gyeong-un was no exception.


 “…Did you say to stop?”


 “Please… Please stop.”


 Tang In-hae spoke to Mok Gyeong-un in a pleading voice.


 In response, Mok Gyeong-un sneered and replied,


 “You should know that begging doesn’t hold much meaning. If you want me to stop, make me stop directly.”


 With those words, Mok Gyeong-un pretended to swing the black sword energy towards the east side again.


 “R-Run!”


 “Aaah!”


 The Tang Clan warriors within the range of the east side panicked and leaped away, trying to escape the radius.


 Seeing that, Tang Clan Leader Tang In-hae shouted again,


 “They… They are truly innocent. Please, if you are a strong one, show mercy to them with your magnanimity. All of this is something I alone have done. So end it with just me.”


 Perhaps motivated by the sight of their Clan Leader crawling on the ground with his legs severed, begging, some of the frightened Tang Clan warriors cried out,


 “Clan Leader!”


 “How can you surrender to the enemy?”


 “No matter what you have done, we believe in you, Clan Leader!”


 “Warriors of the great Tang Clan! Do not fear and be prepared to die…”


 At that moment…


 -Thud!


 Mok Gyeong-un suddenly stomped his foot.


 The vibration spread from the point of impact to the surroundings.


 -Rumble!


 Just as they wondered what he had done…


 The Tang Clan warriors, who had been trying to boost morale for their Clan Leader, suddenly started screaming in terror as if they had gone mad.


 “Aaaaargh!”


 “Stop! Please! Please stop!”


 “Ahhh!!!!”


 ‘What, what’s happening?’


 ‘Why are they suddenly acting like this?’


 Those around them tried to restrain them, wondering about the unknown abnormal symptoms…


 At that moment…


 “Aaaah!”


 -Slice!


 Suddenly, one of them drew a weapon and slit his own throat.


 “What, what the hell!”


 The Tang Clan warriors who had been trying to stop him were bewildered by his abnormal behavior.


 However, he wasn’t the only one.


 -Stab!


 One of those who had been screaming stabbed his own eye with his finger.


 Someone else, as if he had gone insane, rolled his eyes back and started banging his head against the ground.


 “Hahahaha!”


 -Thud! Thud! Thud!


 Even with several people trying to stop him, it was futile.


 He banged his head so hard that it shattered, and brain matter flowed out.


 “Eek!”


 -Rip rip!


 Some even clawed at their own flesh, tearing off their skin.


 “Stop! I said stop! Please get these things off me!”


 They acted as if something had attached to their entire body.


 Although only about ten people displayed these abnormal behaviors, the Tang Clan warriors fell into chaos at the sight of them harming and killing themselves like mentally deranged individuals.


 They weren’t even poisoned, so what kind of bizarre phenomenon was this?


 Tang Clan Leader Tang In-hae shouted with trembling eyes,


 “Wh-What have you done?”


 “Well, from what I see, it looks like they are harming and killing themselves.”


 “You… You!”


 Does that even make sense?


 It was clear that they suddenly changed like madmen after he stomped his foot.


 What on earth did he do?


 Then, a transmitted voice resonated in his ears.


 -Ah! It would be fun to have the Tang Clan members kill each other in a bloodbath at this point. It would be a delightful sight to see blood relatives slaughtering one another.


 ‘!?’


 Judging by his smiling face, he was genuinely enjoying this.


 Was this bastard a demon who had ascended from hell?


 How could he orchestrate something like this?


 At most, he had only killed that damn old man who had raised him, yet he was on the verge of miserably annihilating the entire main clan.


 Mok Gyeong-un smiled at him and slightly raised his foot, transmitting a message.


 -Do you also want to see…


 Before the message could even finish…


 “Yes! I killed Jang Mun-no, the one who raised you!”


 ‘!!!!!!’


 As Tang Clan Leader Tang In-hae’s shout echoed throughout, the entire Tang Clan fell into silence.


 The Tang Clan warriors looked at him with shocked expressions.


 After all, there was no one among them who didn’t know that Jang Mun-no was from a branch family of the Tang Clan.


 But he killed him? What was this about?


 As they wondered, Tang In-hae continued with a trembling voice,


 “Ye Song-ah, the one with a special power… To obtain that child… I revealed the hidden location of the Holy Fire Priestess, no, that old woman of the Ye Clan from the Fire Faith Order, to have her captured by the palace. I killed Jang Mun-no with the Formless Poison, and I intended to kill you in the same way.”


 -Murmur murmur!


 Soon, the hall that had been silent began to stir.


 

  “Clan… Clan Leader!”


 “Why are you doing this?”


 “You’re lying to save us…”


 Some of the loyal executives and warriors of the Tang Clan tried to deny it, but…


 “…No. It’s all true. I even tried to abandon all the clan members here and flee to the Righteous Alliance with only Ye Song-ah when you appeared and fought against the supreme master of the Yoo Clan who was protecting our clan, fearing that I might die. The carriage outside is proof of that.”


 As soon as he finished speaking…


 The eyes of the Tang Clan members, once filled with trust, gradually turned cold.


 How could such words come out of the mouth of a martial clan leader?


 -Grip!


 Faced with their changing gazes, Tang Clan Leader Tang In-hae gritted his teeth and clenched his fists.


 Isn’t this what you really wanted, you bastard?


 To reveal the ugly secrets I had hidden and walk the path of ruin.
