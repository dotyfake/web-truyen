# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 191 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Baek Seo-gun nghe được Hao Wenzhu tiết lộ thông tin về quá khứ của Ma Gwang-ik-ju. Theo đó, Ma Gwang-ik-ju không được Jeong Ban-ak yêu thương và luôn sống khép kín. Jeong Ban-ak tìm cháu gái thất lạc khắp nơi nhưng lại không hề nhắc đến con trai thứ ba. Baek Seo-gun nghi ngờ Jeong Ban-ak đã không đối xử tốt với con trai mình.

Hao Wenzhu khẳng định thông tin của mình là chính xác, có được nhờ mạng lưới thu thập tin tức của Hao Mun (Haomun). Baek Seo-gun quyết định tự mình đi tìm hiểu sự thật. Cô nhớ lại những lời dạy của Jeong Ban-ak và cách Ma Gwang-ik-ju sử dụng kiếm pháp Liên Hoa (Lotus) để đối phó với Nhị Khí Kiếm (Igigeom) của mình. Nếu Ma Gwang-ik-ju không nhận được tình yêu thương xứng đáng, những lời nói và hành động của cô có thể đã gây ra ảnh hưởng tiêu cực. Baek Seo-gun lên đường đến núi Jongnam, nơi con trai thứ hai và cháu gái của Jeong Ban-ak đang tu luyện, để tìm hiểu rõ hơn.

Trong khi đó, tại giải đấu, Unhwaryeon hạ thấp Ma Gwang-ik-ju, đánh giá thấp kỹ năng của cậu và yêu cầu cậu phải chịu sự giám sát của mình. Tuy nhiên, Ip Hwang Dae-hyeop (Ip Hwang Dae-hyeop) đã lên tiếng bênh vực Ma Gwang-ik-ju, khen ngợi tài năng của cậu và chỉ trích Unhwaryeon vì thái độ kiêu ngạo. Ông nói rằng việc một người trẻ tuổi như Ma Gwang-ik-ju tham gia giải đấu là một điều hiếm thấy và đáng được tôn trọng.

Unhwaryeon chấp nhận lời thách đấu của Ma Gwang-ik-ju và tuyên bố sẽ nhường bước. Ma Gwang-ik-ju tự tin tuyên bố sẽ đánh bại Unhwaryeon trong hai chiêu. Cậu sử dụng một kỹ thuật đặc biệt để phân tích cấu trúc khí động học của Unhwaryeon và tìm ra điểm yếu của cô.

Trong một khoảnh khắc giao tranh, Ma Gwang-ik-ju đã chạm vào vùng bụng dưới của Unhwaryeon. Sau đó, cậu sử dụng Nhãn Pháp (eye method) để nhìn thấu sơ hở trong Hosin Gang-gi (Hosin Gang-gi - một loại phòng thủ bằng nội công) của Unhwaryeon. Cậu nhẹ nhàng hạ cô xuống sàn, khiến cô kinh ngạc. Ma Gwang-ik-ju bước đi, để lại Unhwaryeon thất bại.

Ma Gwang-ik-ju tuyên bố Ip Hwang-seong (Ip Hwang-seong) chấp nhận thử thách và tham gia vào Gaepa War (Gaepa War) của Guimeng (Guimeng). Cậu giật lấy lá cờ biểu tượng của chiến thắng, khẳng định vị thế của mình.

It was said that the growth of the young Ma Guang-ik-ju was not smooth. Hao Wen-ju’s speculation was leaked.


Suddenly.


The sound disappeared around the pavilion where the main table was placed.


It felt like frost had settled on Baek Seo-gun’s body, which was straightening its back. It was a wave that forced silence.


A cold breeze blew. It blew the ends of my gray hair from the nape of my neck and drifted away.


A state where the power of aerodynamics is harmonized with the mind and body. She unknowingly fully revealed the presence of Hanam Seonggeomjeon.


“What did you say?”


Baek Seo-gun quietly asked back. The smile on his lips disappeared without a trace.


She began to recall the time when she had worked with Jeong Ban-ak’s son in Chiljunghyeop. What did she say?


“They say that he didn’t grow up to be the son of a large landowner. I didn’t hear much about him, but… … .”




Hao Wenzhu continued speaking, slowly pushing up his collar.


“If you are a third-rate military man who owns a large piece of land and exercises your rights, it is essential to persuade the people together with Jihyeon. It is also necessary for a good harvest. Since you have eaten and drunk well, work harder… … You understand, right? It is said that the head of the Jeong family held banquets frequently. Since a Hwahwagongja named Jeong Daemyeong or Jeong Ban-ak sat in the head of the Jang family, he must have shown off his power even through banquets.”


Prince Jeong Dae-myeong was a person with superstitious beliefs that bordered on stubbornness since childhood.


It was said that if you use someone without compensation, bad luck will come. Baek Seo-gun also benefited from being a maid. Things outside would not have been any different.


“so.”


She pursed her lips slightly.


Hao Wenzhu was not particularly intimidated. He was also a master of the wave defense system with a unique temperament in the world.


The way he opens his mouth calmly gives off the air of a hero.


“The first and second sons of Jeongbanak were the only powerful families in Shinya-hyeon, but the third son was never there. It is said that he never attended a single event in his entire short life. He was sometimes seen walking around the village alone. Unlike the other direct descendants, he was very discouraged. Even that became a secluded family at some point.”


“… … .”




“Jeong Ban-ak searched so hard for his granddaughter who had not yet learned to walk, but he did not say a word about his third son. The testimonies of many people in Shinye-hyeon are consistent. When some of the commoners at the banquet asked Jeong Ban-ak about his third son, he would chase them away, saying that they were disturbing public morals. After that, no one searched for Jeong Yeon-shin… … That’s the story.”


“… Aren’t you mistaken? Even though the Jeong family is a third-rate family, it’s not that they don’t have a genealogy. In Shinya-hyeon, they have a power comparable to Ji-hyeon, so how could mere commoners know the secrets of their family?”


“Can I swear a little?”


Hao Wenzhou, with his eyebrows furrowed, spoke roughly like a back-alley thug. Hao Wen was a sect that protected the lower classes of the Central Plains by gathering them as disciples.


When Moon-ju was dealing with his close friend, he was not careful with his words and actions even if the other person was a swordsman.


Baek Seo-gun, who had been lowering his eyelashes as if lost in thought, raised his head.


“what?”


“If it’s a sword, then it’s all there is to it, that’s what I’m saying.”


Hao Wenzhu continued speaking slowly.


“It is only natural that you do not know the exact details. You are not wrong. It is the intimate family history of a family with considerable power. However, when it comes to collecting and refining the rumors scattered throughout the world, Haomun’s skills are capable of keeping Gae-bi under his eyes. That is, unless it is a matter of the old school. Are you doubting the capabilities of the main text now?”




“… … .”


Sarak.


The white sleeves of Baekseo-gun brush against the main table.


She stood up without saying a word. Hao Wenzhu looked up at Baek Seo-jun.


“You haven’t had a single drink. Where are you going?”


“I’ll have to find out for myself. I said before that there are more direct descendants who survived.”


She muttered quietly.


Hao Wenzhu nodded coolly.


“Jeong Ban-ak’s second son and granddaughter entered Jongnam’s school. The head of the Jeong family has established a very large merchant group in Gaebong… … The other workers are probably not of interest to you.”


“Let’s go to Jongnam Mountain. Since it’s in Seomyeon, it’ll be close enough to see the young prince.”


Hao Wenzhu’s lips twitched at her words.


“Are you calling Magwangikju a nobleman just now? The greatest swordsman in the world… … .”


Baek Seo-gun did not answer. The skin beneath his neat eyebrows trembled slightly.


It was a fateful relationship. It taught me the teachings of Jeongbanak after a long period of struggle.


What Magwangikju Seomyega pulled out to counter her Igigeom was a lotus harvesting sword.


Yeongcheon Geomgwi acknowledged Jeongyeonshin for both blood ties and martial arts. The maid who had become noble accepted her forgotten past.


But what if the boy doesn’t receive the love he deserves at home?


‘I, my words and actions are… … .’


I remember the words I said to Jeong Ban-ak’s son, who was proud of himself. My mind, which had always been clear, became clouded by a single sword.


A dull feeling came over him, as if something was stabbing his brain. Baek Seo-gun thought. This is crazy… … .




Suddenly, Hao Wenzhou opened his eyes.


“More than that, Jongnamhaeng? You’re trying to cause a big incident. Don’t you know how much influence the swordsman of Simmu-ryeon has on the old faction? Please get to know yourself. It’s not like you’re trying to start a war with the old faction… … .”


“It’s no use to me to steal one or two lowly servants. Don’t make a fuss.”


It was a locked voice.


Baekseo-gun set out that day, repelling the men who were trying to carry him out, with only a sword tucked into his waistband.


The ultimate lightness of air moved over the quiet corridor. The new form of the sword disappeared as if it was in disarray.


\* \* \*


When the first one of the Ungajeilkwon was discussing the Magwangikju.


Unhwaryeon did not lower her voice. The voice directed at the young Ma Gwangikju resonated clearly.


He evaluated the boy’s martial arts skills, and advised him as if he was worried about the future of the new lord of Iphwangseong, and told him to come under his supervision as a senior.


It was a disparaging remark that surrounded and belittled the island of Magwangikju.


It may have been the words and actions of the leader of the already ruined Alliance. Forty-five elite masters were defeated one after another by the young lord.


The Murim Alliance’s Gaepada War had already reached its demise. It would be difficult to completely save face in any way.


There is no way to avoid defeating even just one Magwangikju.


Unlike Seomye, who had developed the ultimate form of Shihwamugeuksu, Ungajeilkwon only received the hand attack. Only one move in the fifth combination was different.

Among the warlords, those who had mastered the art of eye magic or had an extraordinary eye for detail noticed that Ma Gwang-ik-ju had suffered a loss.


Each face had its own unique emotion.


“You’re looking at things differently? I find it interesting how strange your eyes are. Come in here and take a look.”


The distinct voice of Kwon Mu-gong Eon Hwa-ryeon made the difference between superior and inferior. However, the voice of Ip Hwang Dae-hyeop was louder.


“The masters of the Menghui are indeed different. This Heonwon Mo is impressed.”


The energy in his voice spreads very naturally. It resonates from the audience seats to all directions, and for a moment, even Unhwaryeon glances at Heonwonchang.


Heonwonchang continued speaking in a pretended manner. It seemed like he was talking to the person next to him who had said he was in love with Unhwaryeon.


“Isn’t it impressive that he is so proud of his age? Now, in front of a young boy who has just graduated from Jihak? As expected of a fair and just Baekdo Daebangpa, they treat each other as equals even if their age difference is extreme. It’s a truly transparent atmosphere. It’s unconventional, but it seems like a behavior worth learning, so it’s worthy of the name Martial Arts Association. Isn’t that right?”


“That seems to be the case… … .”


The middle-aged man who answered absentmindedly closed his mouth. He seemed to suddenly realize what was going on. Heonwonchang smiled and patted him on the shoulder.


The sight of him cheering for Unhwaryeon from the side was unsightly for a master of the Iphwangseong clan, but now it seemed that his fatigue was finally subsiding.


Tae-Yeon-Ryong, sitting on the other side, raised the corners of his mouth as if he was proud.


The warlords who had been chattering noisily in the heat fell silent for a moment.


Heonwonchang.


Even if it was just a little, it brought about a new perspective on the stage. The repeated winning streak had made the age of Ma Gwang-ik-ju fade away.


When I think back on it, I realize that something that is hard to happen in the world of martial arts has happened. It happens to anyone.


While the main players of the Menghui were losing to a boy who was not even a year old, a powerful figure who was expected to be the next Ungaju provoked the young Ma Gwang-ikju.


Rather, it was a matter of saving the face of the boy and even the Emperor’s family. There were probably more than fifteen masters in black.


The intention of the General Office of the Imperial Palace was right. The thousand warlords in this place will spread the rumor throughout the world.


At this moment, Ip Hwang Dae Hyeop put an end to the mission that Jeong Yeon Shin had been given. Without caring about anyone’s gaze.




Even if you lose here, you win.


If they were to win the Non-Combat, the aftereffects of that victory would not stop at Korea and China.


It was a task that even Zhuge Liang, sitting in the leader’s barracks, had difficulty stopping.


“The ramblings have been long. Your Majesty, please begin briefly.”


Heonwonchang said while lightly touching the hero’s forehead. It seemed like he was trying to avoid the question.


“You have a capable subordinate.”


Unhwaryeon spoke to Jeongyeonshin. There was a small hint of admiration in her voice, as if she had seen through the lines of Heonwonchang’s story.


It was different from the sight of many of the men of the Maenghoe sitting under the sunshade, staring blankly at the Hyeonwonchang.


Free from the hustle and bustle of necessity.


It was the appearance of a strong man.


She opened her eyes narrowly and pursed her lips.


“The remaining five will be enough. I will yield the player.”


This is the face he had when he was drinking at the bar. He was swinging his right arm, which was extended from his orange sleeveless uniform, in a big wave.


It seemed as if he was lightly loosening up his body, but with one movement, a transparent wave of energy arose and distorted the atmosphere.


It seemed to have definitely relaxed the acupoints. It was a sign of the power to be unleashed.


“Two numbers.”


The boy opened his mouth slowly.


“You lose in two seconds.”


“what?”


Unhwaryeon’s eyebrows furrowed. It seemed as if she was not approaching him with empty words.




It was a conversation between masters who had directly shared their feelings. They looked into the other person’s mind through their breathing, heartbeat, the subtle movements of their fingertips, and the form of their facial muscles.


In the realm of the rising, the sense of turmoil has a way of telling us a lot.


I was too relaxed. With the main event in front of me.


It was something that Jeong Yeon-shin didn’t necessarily say.


Damn it.


He took a step. He did not utter a new law. He continuously circulated the light of the law through the facial veins.


Every time the energy passed through the pupil point on the outside of both eyes, light reached the pupil.


A white light flows faintly from the boy’s eyes.


It was not a law. It was far from being a perfection that could be called complete ignorance.


‘The method of seeing’ is said to be a much more complex and detailed martial art than the method of tonap. It is rare to find an eye method that can be called a technique.


It was a study that existed only in some Sega and Gupa, whose history was older than the Ming Dynasty. The boy also only gained a small clue when he encountered Zhuge Qing’er.


For now, I just let the energy out through my eyes and let it return to my eyeballs.


The emission and absorption of Mancheonhwawoo were carried out on the light wheel. The delicate operation of Jeongyeonshin’s unique true energy was felt with a texture lighter than smoke.


It was an act of analyzing the aerodynamic structure of the Unhwaryeon.


‘The internal energy rules of the self-defense technique are fixed.’


I only checked her pubic area, abdomen, and shoulders. There was no need to scan her entire body.


It was because Unhwaryeon could notice it and it was enough to dig up the point.


Wow!


Unhwaryun’s body filled his field of vision. As the boy took a step, he narrowed the distance between them by three steps. He seemed to feel impatient at Jeongyeonshin’s words.


He spread his arms wide as if he was going to give up the player, with the exaggeration typical of a midfielder, and waves of aerodynamic force were surging from his hands.




The moment one move was made, it seemed as if a counterattack from the joint technique was about to fly. The air itself was strict.


Bam.


The boy’s index and middle fingers touched her pubic area. The distance between their bodies was as if they were stuck together.


I could even feel Unhwaryeon’s breath on the left shoulder of the black robe with one sleeve blown off. It was very deep and faint.


Perhaps because there were no particular waves, she allowed Jeongyeonshin’s hand to touch her with her eyes that were gleaming with colorless light.


The gaze looking down at my collarbone came like an eerie blade.


That was the end of it.


Wow!


A fiery wave of light erupted from her two hands. In an instant, the air became distorted. Was she aiming for an overwhelming victory?


The technique of wrapping Jeongyeonshin’s arms like a consul was beyond the scope of a sword.


At the same time as the sensation of his collar being violently brushed against his skin, the boy was immersed in the realm of extreme speed.


The surroundings became slow. The feeling of Unhwaryeon’s bare arm creeping up the black sleeve of her right arm was also like that.


It was accompanied by the unique floating feeling of Jinju Eon-ga Hosin Gang-gi. The flow of thoughts raced like a whirlwind.


‘Ignorance. Carelessness.’


As I took a step forward, I already had insight into her. The structure of the true energy that made up the self-defense weapon was mysterious.


It flowed in the form of irregularly intersecting Bagua patterns. It had a very solid texture.


It’s okay.


The upper part of my brain was heating up my head and was glowing. I split the moment into a hundred. My mind seemed to be seeping into a pure white flash.


The boy slightly lowered his elbow while holding the Unhwaryeon’s forehead.


It moved strangely, as if responding gently to her bare-handed restraint. With its radiant head, it estimated the Eight Trigrams of the inner energy barrier.




‘The Post-Heavenly Eight Trigrams. Geon, Tae, Gon. I have to insert them in a tenth of my exhalation… … Now is the time.’


There was no reason to break the true energy structure of the Hosin Ganggi. It was thanks to the long conversation of Ungajeilkwon.


If you follow the knot of the air force and insert your internal energy, a single stream of true energy will transform into the internal energy method.


Young Ma Gwang-ik-ju brought the martial arts down to the realm of the senses.


Swish.


Just before his two hands were torn apart in Unhwaryeon’s arms, the boy was spinning the Neungbeop Gwangryungi northwest, southwest, and west.


It was a moment when the legs of the two masters overlapped and their arms became entangled. Jeong Yeon-shin applied force to the sword that touched her shin.


The sharp, sharp edge of the blade seeps into her hilt.


Hwagae (華蓋), Seon-gi (璇璣), Cheon-dol (天突). The invisible power of the spur cut off the blood vessels and veins of Mingchi Eorim one by one.


“what……!”


Unhwaryeon’s empty breath tickled his ears. The boy clearly sensed the feeling of her entire body shaking.


They were covering each other with narrow gaps. The waves of true energy were scattered over the black robe of the Magwangikju.


The moment he silently added strength to the light of the sword, Unhwaryeon’s entire body muscles sank heavily. The bundles of tendons repeatedly contracted and relaxed as they pleased.


I’m a repeater. I’m completely into it.


Slowly.


Jeongyeonshin laid her down on the floor. Unhwaryeon opened her eyes wide, gasping for breath.


It seemed as if he had only just realized what trick he had been used against him. His slightly parted lips were a testament to the master’s shock.


The boy looked down at her indifferently, then slowly started walking away.


Thud, thud.


I felt a sense of relief as I walked towards the flag of Heonwonchang. If I had fought with my own martial arts skills, I would have lost.


It doesn’t matter whether it was Meng Hui, who was cornered, who instructed Unhwaryeon to do something with his mouth, or whether Ungajeilkwon’s arrogance grew bigger and bigger by destroying the Shihwamugeuksu.


It was a result that would be repeated again and again as long as his enemies were unaware of his lifespan and constitution.


“Ip Hwang-seong accepted the challenge. So this Ma Gwang-ik-ju participated in the Gaepa War of Guimeng.”


The boy talked as he walked.


“Now that the case is settled, the flag is unbroken.”


I grabbed the flagpole stuck in one corner of the stage with one hand. The cool sensation of the steel ran up my arm.


The refreshing cold air seemed to cool even my upper body.


Hwaaaaak!


He raised the waves of the divine law with his whole body. The gust of wind spread out along the hem of his pitch-black clothes.


“This is what the main lord will take back.”


Kwak!


The boy pulled out the flag roughly and forcefully.


In the heavy silence that had settled around the stage, a white long coat tied to a flagpole flapped loudly.
