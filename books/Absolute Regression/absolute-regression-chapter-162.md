# Absolute Regression Chapter 162 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Seo Dae-ryong chiến thắng đối thủ Lee Hyu của gia tộc họ Lý ở Sơn Đông (Shandong Lee Family) trong vòng loại thứ hai của Tiểu Long Chiến (Little Dragon Battle) và tiến vào top 8. Cậu tự tin hơn khi đấu với Đạo thuật (Taoism) nhờ vào việc luyện tập Huyết Thiên Kiếm Đạo (Blood Heavenly Sword’s Tao).

Tôi trêu chọc Seo Dae-ryong về việc cậu có thể rời khỏi vị trí Thế Giả (Sejak) và gia nhập Thông Thiên Các (Tongcheon-gak) hoặc trở thành cánh tay phải của tôi nếu tôi vô địch. Cậu khẳng định vẫn muốn làm cánh tay phải của tôi dù tôi có trở thành người mạnh nhất thiên hạ.

Ngày hôm sau, Chu Ho (Chu Ho) lo lắng khi thấy sắc mặt Jin Ha-ryeong không tốt trước trận đấu. Cô đang buồn vì không gặp Geomyeon (Kiếm Vũ Cực - Geommugeuk) hay Josin (Tào Thần) kể từ sau buổi tiệc. Cô lo sợ Josin sẽ trả thù những người hầu của cô.

Tuy vậy, Jin Ha-ryeong đã chiến thắng trận đấu một cách ngoạn mục và tiến vào vòng tám. Cô nghe thấy tiếng Kiếm Vũ Cực cổ vũ mình và ra hiệu cho anh ta về lời hứa ăn mì cùng nhau.

Sau trận đấu, Jin Ha-ryeong gặp Kiếm Vũ Cực và nói rằng họ không nên gặp nhau để tránh nguy hiểm cho anh. Cô thú nhận đến đây vì lời hứa trước đó. Cô cùng Kiếm Vũ Cực đến Đông Hồ (Dongho), nơi anh từng hứa sẽ dẫn cô đến. Tại đây, cô ngỡ ngàng trước vẻ đẹp của cảnh vật.

Jin Ha-ryeong hỏi Kiếm Vũ Cực rằng liệu anh có ở lại Minh (Murim Alliance) nếu không có chuyện gì xảy ra. Anh đáp rằng anh sẽ ở lại bên cạnh cô. Cô nhắc lại chuyện mình đã công khai hẹn hò với anh, và anh nói rằng phần còn lại là việc của anh. Kiếm Vũ Cực nói rằng anh không thích ai can thiệp vào cuộc sống của mình.

Jin Ha-ryeong ngỏ ý muốn làm bạn với Kiếm Vũ Cực và anh đồng ý. Cô dặn anh nếu ai gây khó dễ thì cứ nói là bạn của cháu gái Minh Chủ (leader of the martial arts world).

Trên đường trở về, Kiếm Vũ Cực bị Josin chặn lại. Josin chế nhạo anh vì dám qua lại với Jin Ha-ryeong và nói rằng cô đã bị vấy bẩn vì một kẻ thấp hèn như anh. Hắn đe dọa sẽ lột da anh nếu anh không làm theo lời hắn. Josin yêu cầu Kiếm Vũ Cực phải tham dự buổi tiệc tối nay, cạo râu, chải chuốt và mặc quần áo đắt tiền. Hắn hứa sẽ cho anh 100.000 lượng nếu anh làm theo.

Sau khi Josin rời đi, Kiếm Vũ Cực yêu cầu người của Minh bí mật báo cáo toàn bộ cuộc gặp gỡ cho Minh Chủ, đồng thời nói rằng anh sẵn sàng tự mình đối phó với Josin.

Tối hôm đó, Jin Ha-ryeong đến dự buổi tiệc do Josin tổ chức. Cô buộc phải đến vì Josin đã mời Kiếm Vũ Cực. Josin xin lỗi cô và Kiếm Vũ Cực về những hành động trước đây. Đúng lúc đó, Kiếm Vũ Cực xuất hiện, khiến mọi người đổ dồn sự chú ý về phía anh.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-161/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-163/)162nd Time to peel the bean pods.




The second round of qualifying has begun.


As the thirty-two were reduced to sixteen, the excitement of the Little Dragon Battle grew even hotter. Now, only the late-comers who were famous not only in their own town but also in the surrounding areas remained.


“Okay, then I will win for the Lord of the Martial Arts World!”


Seo Dae-ryong said it as a joke, but it also contained his determination.


This time, the opponent is Lee Hyu from Shandong Lee Family.


A showdown between sorcery and sorcery.


Rather, Seo Dae-ryong was more confident about this fight than the previous one.


“For some reason, I feel more at ease dealing with Taoism than with other martial arts. Why is that?”


Since he was learning the Blood Heavenly Sword’s Tao, he had a high level of understanding of Taoism. That’s why he felt relatively more comfortable with Taoism.


“Our master is letting his guard down.”




“No, absolutely not.”


Seo Dae-ryong waved his hand. It would be unfair to say he was careless. He was working hard like he was born for this competition.


“Hey, did you see the fight? They’re not easy opponents. Don’t let your guard down.”


“All right.”


That being said, I expected Seo Dae-ryong to win this fight. The opponent’s magic was at a disadvantage compared to the magic Seo Dae-ryong had mastered.


As I expected, Seo Dae-ryong won without difficulty.


Seo Dae-ryong came down from the stage, waving to the cheering heroes.


“I’m finally in the top eight!”


Now, Seo Dae-ryong will be selected for the elite organization of the Murim Alliance.


“It’s a shame. Now I have a chance to live a new life.”




“Do you want to stay? If you want to remain as a Sejak, Tongcheon-gak will welcome you with open arms.”


“What are you doing?”


“A beggar who hides his identity and works in the enemy’s camp. A genius brain of the first student of Hwangcheon-gak! A top-notch scholar who also has martial arts skills! What do you think?”


“You say the leader of the martial arts world already knows your true identity and mine?”


“Did you remember?”


“Don’t even think about leaving me behind! There’s nothing better than winning the title, the position of your right-hand man. Even if it’s not the Little Dragon Tournament but the World’s Best Martial Arts Tournament, the position of your right-hand man is still better.”


“Is that really true?”


“sure.”


“Now, imagine! You’ve become the best in the world. The entire martial arts world respects you. Do you still like being my right-hand man?”


“yes.”




“Even the demons you are so afraid of are smiling at you. You accidentally stepped on the evil Soma’s foot, so that’s possible. Would you like to step on this foot too? Say so. Okay, is that okay?”


“Yes! But my right arm is better.”


“The beauties of the world are lining up to meet me just once. Is that really so?”


“Even if you were a one-armed warrior, you would still be cool, my lord.”


I burst out laughing, and Seo Dae-ryong laughed along. He was more into martial arts than women these days, so this joke was actually funny. Where would you send such a cute Seo Dae-ryong?


“Just go! If you’re not here, the right-hand man position will be taken by the general.”


“Ah! I’m having trouble deciding whether to give it to someone else.”


We left unarmed with the great feat of advancing to the West Sea and the Pal River.


\* \* \*


The next day, as Jin Ha-ryeong was about to go up on stage, his escort Chu Ho asked him.


“Is there anything that feels uncomfortable?”


Jin Ha-ryeong turned his head at his concern.


“why not?”


“You look unwell.”


“Don’t worry. It’s okay.”


In fact, her mood was depressed.


I haven’t met with either Geomyeon or Josin since the banquet my grandfather held.


If someone like Cho Shin harbored a grudge, killing a person was not a big deal. If he killed someone without leaving any evidence, even if there was a strong suspicion, the person would not be held accountable. And in this world, no one would be interested in the death of a servant.


I really want to destroy Jo-sin until he asks for my life. But I can’t do that because of my grandfather. As long as my grandfather is the leader, if I cause an accident, my grandfather will have to take full responsibility for the cleanup. Yes, hold on, hold on.


Care is tolerated, but there are things that are not tolerated well. The human mind is really strange. When I was watching it comfortably, I didn’t think much of it, but when I couldn’t meet it, I started to miss it for no reason. What’s so good about an arrogant servant who always makes people flustered?




As she stepped onto the stage, cheers erupted from all directions.


“Hubei Ilmi! Jinharyeong! Hubei Ilmi! Jinharyeong!”


“Cheer up, Miss Jin!”


“I love you, Miss Jin!”


“Let’s definitely win!”


“Let’s eat noodles!”


“Go for it, Miss Jin!”


She heard clearly. A strange and welcome word mixed in with the cheering.


Her gaze turned to the warlords. Wherever her gaze landed, cheers erupted. Those who were moved by the sight of Hubei looking at them chanted her name at the top of their lungs.


She found the sword dance among them. She looked at him and nodded once. It was a signal to eat noodles together.


That day, contrary to Chuho’s worries, she displayed her skills better than ever. Her sword was fast and accurate, and her technique was elegant.


She also advanced to the eighth round with a spectacular victory that thrilled the onlookers.


\* \* \*


The sword dance performance was already waiting in the guest house.


“Congratulations on your victory.”

Instead of receiving congratulations, Jin Ha-ryeong spoke firmly.


“We shouldn’t meet.”


“Why not?”


“You ask because you don’t know? You can’t do that because it would put you in danger.”


“But why did you come?”


“that…….”


After hesitating for a moment, she said something unexpected.


“Because of a promise.”


“What promise?”


“You’ll know when you go.”


She left the guest house with the sword dance.


“Do you know how to do light air?”


Do you know how to fly? Geommugeuk answered with a smile.


“I know.”


“No. I’ll go and find a horse.”


She asked for words as if she had asked for nothing. Geommugeuk did as she said.


“Do you know how to ride a horse?”


“Usually, a servant is someone who leads the horse, but the servant you are seeing is special. He rides well.”


So I borrowed two horses and ran.


The place she took the sword dance was Dongho, located east of the Murim Alliance.




“Didn’t you ask me to show you around here before?”


“Did you remember that?”


“We talked so much that you forgot about that?”


As he spoke, Jin Ha-ryeong had this thought in his mind.


‘So, what kind of conversation did we have to make such a fuss? A fuss in front of Grandfather, a fuss in front of Josin. Even Dongho came.’


She looked at the swordsman. His face was still visible because of his disheveled hair and beard covering his face, and his clothes were old and dirty. What on earth was so good about this man?


Then the swordmaster spoke to her.


“Shall we go there?”


“Yes? Why?”


“I think the view would be better if you look from that hill over there.”


Jin Ha-ryeong was truly amazed at the place where Geommu-geuk had taken him.


“It’s really beautiful!”


It was a breathtaking spot where you could see the beauty of Dongho at a glance.


“How did you know about this place?”


“Originally, the servants were well-placed.”


Jin Ha-ryeong really felt that this person was unknowable.


The two of them stood there in silence for a while, lost in Dongho’s beauty.


The person who broke the silence was Jin Ha-ryeong.


“You, my lord, will join the Murim Alliance. If it were normal, you would have stayed, right?”


“Why do you keep sending me away? I will stay with you, my lord.”




Jin Ha-ryeong looked at Geommu-geuk. Geommu-geuk spoke as if he had already made up his mind.


“You’ve done all you had to do by telling people that you’re dating me that day. The rest is up to me.”


“It would be dangerous.”


“How did you feel when your grandfather tried to force you into marriage?”


“I didn’t like it.”


“Me too. I don’t like anyone interfering with my life.”


“I don’t like it, but I won’t die.”


“A married life you don’t like can be more painful than death.”


“!”


After a moment, Jin Ha-ryeong said.


“You’ve never even been married.”


“I saw someone really suffering up close. Don’t worry about me.”


“I don’t understand why you are a servant.”


“Then what do I look like?”


After a moment, she held out her hand and said.


“The lord’s granddaughter is my friend. Let’s be friends.”


She didn’t know her own heart. Why was she getting into such a deep relationship with a mere servant?


“Isn’t it a big loss for you, young lady?”


“Why do you argue about the gains and losses between friends? Then you’re not friends.”


The swordsman grabbed her outstretched hand tightly.




“You’re friends with the lord’s granddaughter!”


“Friends with your servant!”


After a firm handshake, she said:


“If anyone bothers you, tell them that my friend is the granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world! Got it?”


“Yeah.”


“I’ll go somewhere and brag about it. The most special servant in the world is my friend.”


“The next time you need that special friend, call him. Maybe that special friend will do something you never thought possible.”


Jin Ha-ryeong looked at the sword dance.


“You’re weird.”


This man didn’t seem like he would die. This man didn’t seem like he would get into trouble. If I just keep doing this, I don’t know how much I’ll regret it later when this man gets killed by Jo-shin. What will I do then…?


The two people who returned from the club parted ways at the entrance to Infinite to avoid attention.


Geommugeuk was returning alone when someone blocked his way.


A poisonous snake, that was Chosin.


“Did you enjoy the outing?”


The Sword Master looked at him with a very frightened expression. He decided to wait and see how he would act until he found out whether he was only here for the wedding or if he had some kind of relationship with Cheonmyeonghoe.


“You were so confident when you were with her, so why are you nervous when you’re alone?”


“If you touch me, Lady Jin won’t just sit there and do nothing.”


When Geommugeuk acted as if he was scared, Josin’s face was filled with laughter.


“You’re just hiding behind a woman.”


Jo Shin walked over with brisk strides and grabbed Geommugeuk by the collar as he backed away.




“Lady Jin has become dirty because of a lowly person like you.”


Jo Shin raised his hand in a flash to strike the sword. Geommu Geuk squeezed his eyes shut and deliberately looked fearful.


“If you thought I wouldn’t kill you because you did that in front of the leader, you were seriously mistaken.”


“Please save me!”


Cho Shin lowered his hand.


“Don’t kill me. It’s no fun if you just kill me. I need to see Miss Jin regret it. I need to see her disappointed in you by removing the bean husks from her eyes. I’ll make her cling to me later.”


Geommu-geuk knows that it is not only for that reason. If he were to die or go missing, Jin Ha-ryeong would never marry him.


When you use the expression “defiled” to describe someone getting married, you can tell what their married life will be like without even having to see it.


“If you don’t do as I say from now on, I’ll peel off all your skin and throw it in the salt shaker. Do you understand?”


“yes!”


“I’m going to invite the late-comers to a banquet tonight. I’ve invited Lady Jin, so you should come too. Also, clean up your hair and shave your beard. You should wear the most expensive clothes you can afford.”


Jo Shin thought that the reason Jin Ha Ryeong liked this guy was because of his unadorned appearance. It’s like a fantasy of young women. A man without any decorations seems more confident. But when you open it, there’s nothing there. Today, I was going to break that.


If this guy keeps wearing expensive clothes that don’t suit him and comes dressed up like he’s trying to look good, it’ll have the opposite effect. In the end, he’ll think, “This guy is no different from any other guy who’s trying to look good to me.” Today, I’ll completely shatter the girl’s illusions.


“If you just cooperate as I say, I will spare your life. I will even give you a lot of money later.”


“How much will you give me?”


“One hundred thousand nyang.”


Geommugeuk opened his eyes wide and greedily at the unexpected amount of money.


“You must give it to me.”


“I always keep my promises. So you should do as I say.”


Cho Shin felt secretly happy.


‘You piece of trash!’


So it will be much easier to use.


As Jo-shin left with light steps, Geommu-geuk, who had been pretending to be a coward, returned to his original form.


“Seeing as you’re offering a hundred thousand nyang, I guess you plan on killing me once you’re done.”


Although he said it as if he was talking to himself, it was something he said for the hidden unmanned person to hear.


“Please report to the lord exactly what happened during this meeting, without leaving out a single word. This is very important to both Lady Jin and the lord.”


Just by hearing this report, the leader of the martial arts world will be able to know Jo Shin’s true feelings.


“And please tell him this too. When this matter is over, I am willing to deal with Jo Shin-do. He will be a long-term threat to Lady Jin. However, the Murim Alliance cannot easily deal with the successor of a prestigious sect. In the end, the conflict of interest will be so entangled that they will have to let him off. Instead, just leave it to me.”


The hidden drone still had no answer.


\* \* \*


That night, Jin Ha-ryeong entered the palace.


The invited guests had already gathered at the garden. She absolutely did not want to come, but Jo Shin invited her and said this.


“I invited that servant, so Miss Jin, please come too.”


When Geomyeon came, he had to come too. He was no longer her servant but her friend. He couldn’t send her to the viper’s den alone.


Jo Shin greeted her with a kind face.


“I called you two today to apologize.”


“You apologize?”


“Yes. That day, my pride kicked in and I unintentionally made a mistake towards you two. I’m sorry.”


Jin Ha-ryeong looked at him with suspicious eyes, but Jo Shin treated her with a gentle expression. Today, he didn’t think of snakes.


‘Yeah, if we’re going to do it, we might as well do it well.’


There is no need to bother this person even for the sake of smoking.


It was just then.


The entrance area began to become noisy, and Jin Ha-ryeong and Jo Shin’s gaze naturally turned in that direction.
