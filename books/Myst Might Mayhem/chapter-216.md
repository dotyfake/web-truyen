 Chapter 216 – Secret Mission (3)


 In the inner court of the imperial palace, there were 87 women donning the robes of concubines.


 This meant that there were 87 women who had received the titles of Talented Maiden, Noble Consort, Consort, Imperial Consort, and Noble Imperial Consort.


 Among these numerous imperial concubines, there were two consorts who were the most favored by the emperor.


 One of them was none other than the Noble Imperial Concort Seo, Seo Yang-hyo.


 The emperor’s favor towards her was so immense that despite the presence of the empress’s grown children, the seven-year-old child she bore became the crown prince.


 As a result, she became one of the four individuals wielding limitless power within the imperial palace.


 Gan-yang, the leader of the advance team, spread out four fingers and spoke while folding them one by one.


 “If we were to name the four individuals with the greatest power in the current imperial palace, they would be His Majesty the Emperor’s younger brother, Prince Gyeong, the Grand Preceptor who also serves as the Supreme Commander of the Central Overseers among the Three Excellencies, the powerful minister Hang Yoon, His Majesty’s second prince, Prince Jong, who was originally the most likely candidate for the throne, and Noble Imperial Concubine Seo, the mother of the current crown prince.”


 He slowly listed them out because Mok Gyeong-un had mentioned being completely unaware of the power dynamics within the imperial palace.


 Having spent his time only in the mountains, Mok Gyeong-un had learned a lot through books but was not well-versed in how the martial arts world or the current Central Plains operated.


 “So, one of the four most powerful figures in the imperial palace is Noble Imperial Concubine Seo.”


 “That’s correct.”


 

 “Then why would such a person help us?”


 Mok Gyeong-un raised a question, finding it incomprehensible.


 He had heard that the relationship between the imperial palace and the martial arts world had improved significantly, but the non-aggression treaty remained unchanged, and only the righteous sects actively interacted with the palace.


 So why would Noble Imperial Concubine Seo, one of the powerful figures in the palace, assist the Heaven and Earth Society, which had even confronted the righteous sects in the past?


 As he pondered, Yoo-bong spoke in a quiet voice as if revealing a secret.


 “Because we were the ones who supported her from the time she was a noble consort until she became the current Noble Imperial Concubine.”


 “The Heaven and Earth Society supported Noble Imperial Concubine Seo?”


 “Yes, that’s right.”


 ‘Hoho.’


 It seemed their claim of having a plan was not an empty one.


 If Noble Imperial Concubine Seo had received support from the Heaven and Earth Society to reach her current position, it would be difficult for her to simply ignore their request for assistance.


 At that moment, the Demon-Subduing monk Ja Geum-jeong, who had been sipping alcohol from a gourd with a dissatisfied expression, spoke up.


 “Hmph. She might agree to a reasonable request, but will she really accept a request that could affect her own position?”


 “……..”


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c4f98310f240f4d43d687", id: "pf-8947-1"}) At his words, none of the advance team members denied it, remaining silent.


 Then, Gan-yang spoke.


 “The Demon-Subduing monk is right about that. When people reach a high position, they tend to easily forget all the hardships they endured to get there.”


 “So there’s a possibility of rejection?”


 “We won’t deny that. The current Noble Imperial Concubine Seo is not the same as before. As the mother of the crown prince, she has risen to a position where it’s difficult for us to exert pressure on her.”


 When a concubine becomes the mother of the crown prince, the title “Imperial” is added to her existing title of “Noble Consort.”


 From that point on, she essentially wields limitless power.


 In this regard, the Heaven and Earth Society found it not entirely pleasing that she, whom they had supported for a long time, had reached such a position. In a sense, she had escaped their control.


 “It won’t work unless there’s a mutual benefit between both sides.”


 “That’s right. That’s why we need to meet Noble Imperial Concubine Seo in advance. Fortunately, with you all joining as the rear team this time, it aligns with her requirements.”


 “Requirements? So there have already been discussions?”

 Seop Chun asked, puzzled.


 To that question, Yoo-bong answered.


 “Yes. We can’t abruptly demand that a powerful figure like the Noble Imperial Concubine, who holds the highest position in the inner court, immediately comply with our request.”


 “……..Then what are those requirements?”


 “She requested that we send properly trained late-stage warriors, just like how the major and minor sects of the righteous faction do.”


 At Yoo-bong’s answer, Mong Mu-yak clicked his tongue.


 Mok Gyeong-un then asked.


 “Why do you do that?”


 “She’s not an ordinary woman, indeed.”


 “Pardon?”


 “Asking the Society to send properly trained late-stage warriors is no different from telling us to move openly in the light, not through spies or from the shadows.”


 Seop Chun also expressed his astonishment.


 “Ha! Even if she helps, she wants to prevent any situation that could harm her.”


 “It seems so.”


 In the case of spies, their ties can be cut off if necessary.


 But if the Society officially dispatches late-stage warriors, the situation becomes different.


 Not only is it difficult to sever ties if a problem arises, but it also leads to a situation where responsibility must be taken.

 Cheong-ryeong asked Mok Gyeong-un.


 To this, Mok Gyeong-un chuckled and said.


 -She’s a clever woman.


 -It seems so. If we move officially, naturally, the one making the request is the one who needs to be mindful. Moreover, they’ll have to take responsibility if something goes wrong. She’s making sure of that.


 -That’s not all.


 -Not all?


 -Yes.


 -Her hunger has been satisfied.


 -Her hunger has been satisfied?


 -Yes.


 -Ah, so that’s what you meant.


 Cheong-ryeong understood what Mok Gyeong-un meant by those words.


 A hungry person may say desperate things due to their hunger, but once that hunger is satisfied, the situation changes.


 They no longer want to make desperate pleas or have a leash around their neck.


 Considering this, it’s not a matter of whether she will readily accept the request or not now that she has gained power.


 Mok Gyeong-un spoke up.


 “She may have been raised by this side, but she’s no longer a pawn that can be controlled as desired.”


 Gan-yang agreed with those words.


 “That’s why we need to appease her to some extent while obtaining what we want. That’s the key to this mission.”


 At Gan-yang’s remark, Yoo-bong added with a smile.


 “But you don’t need to worry too much. Noble Imperial Concubine Seo, whom we have been observing, has not forgotten the help she received from the Society. She simply wants to prevent anything that could negatively impact her and the crown prince, so if we can assure her of that, she will be of great assistance to us.”


 Everyone nodded at these words.


 In any case, their purpose was not to do something to the imperial palace through Noble Imperial Concubine Seo.


 They merely aimed to accomplish the mission assigned by the Society.


 As everyone was coming to terms with this, Mok Gyeong-un alternately glanced at Gan-yang and Yoo-bong from the advance team with a peculiar look in his eyes.


 However, he didn’t say anything in particular.


 Having learned from the advance team how the secret mission would proceed, the rear team, who had not rested at all since arriving here, decided to take a break for about an hour.


 \*\*\*


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) Exhausted, Seop Chun fell into a deep sleep, while Mong Mu-yak engaged in meditation.


 Ja Geum-jeong spent his time sipping alcohol from a gourd, using the roasted deer meat prepared by the advance team as a snack.


 In a quiet place slightly away from the Guan Yu Shrine, Cheong-ryeong, who had come out of the wooden puppet for the first time in a while, was showing something to Mok Gyeong-un while wielding her long pipe.


 It was none other than a sword technique.


 Watching this, Mok Gyeong-un exclaimed in admiration.


 “Ah!”


 The sword technique Cheong-ryeong was demonstrating was the Moon Sword Style.


 However, the Moon Sword Style had changed.


 It had become more refined and flawless compared to the original Moon Sword Style she had taught him.


 Moreover, the sword technique had evolved into a set of movements that incorporated much more complex variations, capable of deceiving and pressuring the opponent.


 After showcasing the evolved Moon Sword Style, Cheong-ryeong asked.


 -What do you think?


 “The sword technique has become flawless.”


 -Is that all?


 “The variations have also increased, making it an even more troublesome sword technique to face.”


 At those words, Cheong-ryeong smiled and nodded.


 -That’s right. After observing that old man’s sword technique on the ship, I realized what was lacking in the Moon Sword Style. So, I took the opportunity to supplement it.


 

 “Excellent.”


 -You memorized everything, right?


 “Yes.”


 -Then forget the previous one.


 “Yes, of course.”


 With an improved sword art available, there was no need to remember the flawed one.


 Cheong-ryeong put the long pipe in her mouth and spoke while puffing out smoke.


 -By the way, you also witnessed that old man’s swordsmanship along with me. Haven’t you realized anything?


 “Realization?”


 -Yes. Did you not gain any insight after seeing that swordsmanship?


 The swordsmanship the old man displayed on the ship was truly shocking.


 As a result, Cheong-ryeong observed it and filled the gaps in the Moon Sword Style, refining the sword techniques to evolve it closer to perfection.


 Now, she was confident that it could surpass his Heaven Sword Style.


 If even she had gained such insights, it would be a lie if this fellow, Mok Gyeong-un, claimed to have realized nothing after witnessing it.


 This guy’s talent was at a level that even she couldn’t fathom.


 She was curious about how that swordsmanship had approached him.


 At that moment, Mok Gyeong-un drew his Evil Commandment Sword.


 -Sreung!


 And with the sword, he assumed a stance she had never seen before.


 Puzzled, Cheong-ryeong asked.


 -What is that?


 The stance Mok Gyeong-un had assumed was neither the old man’s nor her Moon Sword Style.


 To her question, Mok Gyeong-un replied.


 “Originally, the Moon Sword Style required a total of four sword techniques for the first stance. But this time, two more techniques were added, harmonizing six techniques.”


 At those words, Cheong-ryeong smiled and said.


 -Yes. I originally thought four techniques were the most suitable and the limit for a single stance, but that was just my fixed mindset. If more techniques are needed, they can be incorporated to diversify the variations of the stance and compensate for weaknesses.


 She considered six techniques to be the most ideal.


 The current Moon Sword Style was the result of such refinement.


 “Yes. Seeing that, I realized there was no need to be bound by fixed ideas.”


 Cheong-ryeong’s eyes sparkled at those words.


 -Don’t tell me… you also refined the sword techniques like me?


 “No. You know the Moon Sword Style better, so there’s no need for me to refine it.”


 -Then what?


 “I just pondered what would be the most efficient and ideal sword technique for me.”


 -Wait… don’t tell me?


 Is this guy saying he created his own sword technique?


 Creating a sword technique was by no means a simple task.


 It wasn’t merely about swinging the sword, but required the harmony of sword techniques to manifest stances, the sword intent to infuse the sword with qi, and the most suitable breathing path to maximize the power of the stances. All three elements had to be in place.


 Reaching a level where this was possible was referred to as attaining the realm of a Sword Saint.


 ‘Even I spent years refining the Moon Sword Style with that fellow after overcoming the bottleneck.’


 But no matter how impressive the swordsmanship he witnessed was, it was beyond common sense for someone who hadn’t even learned martial arts for long to create his own sword technique.


 However…


 -Seuk!


 Mok Gyeong-un slowly began to move the Evil Commandment Sword.


 As if drawing strokes with a brush, Mok Gyeong-un executed sword techniques in a completely different trajectory from the Moon Sword Style.


 -Chwak!


 The first technique was simple.


 It was just a horizontal stroke, and the second technique was a vertical stroke.


 But as more techniques were added, the variations naturally became more prominent.


 The Moon Sword Style consisted of a total of 24 techniques, and originally, four sword techniques were combined for each stance. But now, with a total of 30 techniques, six sword techniques were combined for each stance to further enhance the variations.


 -Chwak! Chwahchwahchwak!


 The sword techniques displayed by Mok Gyeong-un exceeded ten.


 Given the nature of the sword as a weapon, it was natural for thrusting and slashing to be harmonized.


 As a result, overlapping techniques were bound to appear.


 About half of the sword techniques shown by Mok Gyeong-un resembled those of the Moon Sword Style.


 However, at some point, the techniques began to differ.


 -Chwahchwahchwak! Chwak! Chwak!


 The trajectory of the sword extended to completely unexpected angles.


 Witnessing this, Cheong-ryeong couldn’t help but feel puzzled.


 She got the impression that each and every sword technique Mok Gyeong-un demonstrated did not overlap in trajectory at all.


 ‘There’s no need to make them so different.’


 It seemed that due to his lack of experience in this area, he was approaching the creation of sword techniques in an overly complicated manner.


 With such an approach, the stances would inevitably become difficult as well.


 The sword techniques needed to be combined to create stances, but excluding the initial ten techniques, it looked daunting to figure out how to combine the remaining ones.


 -Chwak!


 “Phew.”


 In the end, Mok Gyeong-un had demonstrated a total of 24 sword techniques.


 Seeing this, Cheong-ryeong clicked her tongue and said.


 -There’s no need to deliberately make the trajectories different. Creating sword techniques like that will ultimately result in overlapping useful techniques, and the rest will be discarded.


 “No. I’ll use all of them.”


 -You don’t need to be greedy with something like this. Mok Gyeong-un.


 “Is that so?”


 -Trying to make the trajectories completely non-overlapping is also being trapped in a fixed mindset. If you truly realized something, don’t be bound by it.


 “I’ll keep that in mind.”


 -Are you ignoring my advice again? Tsk tsk.


 He’s so stubborn.


 Cheong-ryeong thought there was no point in saying more.


 If he tried to combine the sword techniques he created like that, he would eventually realize that her words were right.


 At that moment, Mok Gyeong-un assumed the initial stance again.


 Then…


 “This will be the first stance.”


 It was at that very instant.


 -Chwahchwahchwahchwahchwahchwak!


 Mok Gyeong-un linked the sword techniques and executed a stance.


 However, Cheong-ryeong’s eyes trembled wildly as she watched this.


 ‘What?’


 The reason being, she was curious about which techniques he would combine to execute the stance, but the result unfolding from Mok Gyeong-un’s hands completely overturned all her expectations.


 Cheong-ryeong was momentarily dumbfounded.


 She had naturally assumed that out of the 24 techniques, at most four to six would be combined.


 

  However, the combination of sword techniques Mok Gyeong-un was demonstrating now…


 ‘He’s harmonizing all twenty-four sword techniques into a single stance?’


 It was a combination of techniques that completely defied conventional wisdom.


 24 non-overlapping trajectories were unfolding at an incredible speed, forming a single stance.


 -Chwahchwahchwahchwahchwahchwahchwahchwak!


 It was a sword technique that seamlessly integrated offense and defense without any gaps.


 After executing the stance, breath flowed from Mok Gyeong-un’s mouth.


 The hand gripping the sword trembled, as executing twenty-four techniques simultaneously had strained his muscles.


 ‘!!!!!!!’


 Witnessing this, Cheong-ryeong was left speechless.


 When told not to be bound by fixed notions, he created a stance that defied common sense.


 ‘This guy… he’s really insane.’
