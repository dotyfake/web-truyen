## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Mabul báo với Geommu-yang tin Kwon Ma ủng hộ Khổng Tử. Mabul nhận ra Geommu-yang nghi ngờ sự chân thành của mình do những thất bại gần đây của anh. Anh thừa nhận sự thật này và quyết định chấp nhận bản chất của Geommu-yang, thay vì tức giận như trước đây. Geommu-yang đáp lại bằng lời xin lỗi, thú nhận sự lo lắng khi thấy Mugeuk (nhân vật chính) trưởng thành nhanh chóng. Mabul cảm thấy nhẹ nhõm và hứa sẽ bảo vệ Geommu-yang, xem đây là dấu hiệu của một mối quan hệ tốt đẹp hơn trong tương lai. Tuy nhiên, Geommu-yang vẫn lo lắng, cho rằng Mabul không đủ quyết liệt vì anh không phải là người duy nhất chịu hậu quả nếu thất bại trong cuộc chiến kế vị.

Trong khi đó, Mugeuk luyện tập các kỹ thuật của Jeokkwon dưới ánh trăng. Kwon Ma xuất hiện và hỏi cậu có sợ hắn không. Mugeuk đáp lại rằng hắn trông mệt mỏi, khiến Kwon Ma ngạc nhiên. Mugeuk bày tỏ mong muốn được học võ thuật từ Kwon Ma và chiến đấu với hắn bằng chính những kỹ thuật đó. Lời đề nghị này khiến Kwon Ma bộc phát một luồng năng lượng mạnh mẽ, nhưng Mugeuk đã chống lại bằng cách sử dụng Nhất Quyền Địch Thiên (one fist against heaven).

Kwon Ma hỏi vì sao Mugeuk đến muộn như vậy, nghi ngờ việc cậu đóng hai vai Ma Đầu. Mugeuk đáp rằng cậu muốn gặp Kwon Ma khi đã mạnh hơn. Kwon Ma hỏi liệu Mugeuk có nghiêm túc về việc trở thành đệ tử của hắn không. Mugeuk khẳng định đây là cơ hội duy nhất để Kwon Ma trở thành sư phụ của Thiên Ma. Cậu giải phóng khí thế của mình, cho thấy một bầu trời vô tận và biển sâu thăm thẳm. Kwon Ma kinh ngạc và yêu cầu Mugeuk đưa tay ra, rồi bảo cậu nắm chặt. Sau khi xem xét bàn tay của Mugeuk, Kwon Ma bỏ đi và bảo cậu đến buổi huấn luyện Quyền Đen (Black Fist) vào ngày mai.

Sau đó, Mugeuk đến Akingok để hỏi Soma tà ác về Kwon Ma. Soma tà ác muốn giao đấu với Kwon Ma. Mugeuk trêu chọc Soma tà ác có thể đọc được suy nghĩ của cậu. Soma tà ác hỏi Mugeuk có nhớ máu không, và Mugeuk thừa nhận rằng khi cậu nhớ máu, cậu nghĩ đến Soma tà ác. Soma tà ác cho rằng Kwon Ma ủng hộ Đại Công Tước (Grand Duke) vì ý muốn của cha hắn, người muốn Đại Công Tước kế vị. Hắn khuyên Mugeuk rằng Kwon Ma chưa từng thất bại, và cậu sẽ biết Kwon Ma là người như thế nào khi hắn thua cuộc.

Soma tà ác hỏi Mugeuk vì sao cậu muốn trở nên mạnh mẽ. Mugeuk tiết lộ rằng cậu cảm thấy một ngày nào đó sẽ có một đối thủ đáng gờm xuất hiện mà cậu không thể đánh bại nếu không nỗ lực hết mình. Soma tà ác đáp rằng hắn sẽ đến giải cứu Mugeuk nếu điều đó xảy ra. Mugeuk hứa sẽ chờ đợi. Soma tà ác vẽ một đường trên bức tường trắng và hỏi Mugeuk cậu đã đi được bao xa. Mugeuk vẽ một đường dọc theo đường Sinh Tồn (survival) mà cậu đã vẽ trước đó. Soma tà ác nói rằng giờ đây họ đã là bạn bè, và cùng nhau chiến đấu, ăn uống. Trước khi rời đi, Mugeuk lo lắng về bức tường, nhưng Soma tà ác nói rằng hắn không thích màu của bức tường đó nữa, và từ nay sẽ nhìn vào bức tường này.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-183/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-185/)What kind of person is the 184th Kwonma?




“You look happy.”


Ma-bul smiled and answered Geommu-yang’s words.


“I guess it’s because I bring good news.”


Mabul acted brighter and more energetic than usual.


“I don’t think you need to worry about Kwon Ma. He clearly stated that he supports Confucius.”


Even though it was good news, Geommuyang’s expression didn’t brighten up at all.


“Your Highness, I will speak frankly. I know that Your Highness has been disappointed in me recently. I tried to do my best, but things did not go as planned. Therefore, I apologize to Your Highness.”


Mabul apologized sincerely, without any pretense. It was an extension of the feelings he had felt while watching the sword dance performance while practicing martial arts earlier.


I felt that if I continued like this, I would not be able to win against the Black Swordsman. I needed a change, and I decided that it had to start with me.


“No. I am the one who should apologize.”




Ma-bul felt from Geommu-yang’s reaction that Geommu-yang was flustered and doubting his words.


Geommuyang is a person who tries to see the other person’s backside. He is a person who filters what the other person says. He is currently doubting his own sincerity.


If it were yesterday, Mabul would have been angry at this reaction. He would have thought of the gold between him and Geommuyang.


But I didn’t. Now I’m willing to admit it. This is the nature of the person called Geommuyang. If you don’t like this, you should leave.


Geommuyang spoke calmly, not knowing whether he knew Ma-Bul’s feelings or not.


“When I returned to the church, I was surprised to see that Mugeuk had grown up so much more than I had expected. The Mugeuk I knew was a young wolf, but when I returned, he had grown into a huge tiger. I was so anxious that I was rude to Mabul-nim several times. I apologize.”


The black sheep bowed its head.


Mabul’s heart was relieved. This was enough.


He decided that the gold between himself and Geommuyang was not something that was in danger of breaking and collapsing, but rather a sign of a better relationship in the future. Rather, it was a gold that he could look at and gain strength from when he was sad and having a hard time.


“The Grand Duke is also a tiger. So don’t be afraid and roar to your heart’s content. I will protect you.”




“Thank you.”


Mabul was gaining strength.


Yes, this is how we should approach someone. Just as the sword dance moves to speak to you without hesitation, you should also approach the sword dance with bold strides like this. That way, no matter how this matter ends, you won’t regret it.


Mabul’s gaze turned out the window.


“The moonlight is really nice today.”


But Geommuyang’s eyes were never able to enjoy that beautiful moonlight.


‘This can’t go on.’


As he looked at the moonlight, his eyes moistened, and he thought that he could not win against the sword dance.


‘If you truly care about me, you should not praise me as a tiger, but bring me a trap to catch that tiger.’


In a situation where everything is not enough, where you have to resort to all sorts of tricks and strategies, how can you be so relaxed?




Because he is not as desperate as you. After all, if you lose the fight for succession, you are the only one who will die.


Because the two people’s hearts were different, the moonlight today was different. The moonlight was so soft and warm, yet cold and lonely, shining on the two people.


\* \* \*


I was alone in the moonlit smokescreen, throwing my fists.


Through my training, I have mastered even the first techniques that Jeokkwon teaches. They were difficult, but to me, they still felt easy, like the basics of martial arts. However, since the basics had to be solid, from the moment I first started training, I invested all my time in practicing martial arts.


At that moment, Kwonma walked towards there.


With the shadow cast on his face by the moon, Kwonma looked like a real demon.


“Aren’t you afraid of me?”


“How can you not be scared when you see that face?”


“It’s not that you’re not scared, you take me for granted.”


“Do you like being seen as scary by others? You’ve probably experienced this all your life.”


Kwonma walked slowly and came right in front of me.


He thrust his face in front of me. It was the first time I had seen his face so close. It really looked like a devil born in this world.


“What does it look like up close?”


This is the first time I felt this way when I saw Amazon’s face.


“You look tired.”


“!”


“What on earth is making the Demon Lord of the Heavenly Demon Sect so tired? Is it the iron fists? Or that cliff? Or is there something else?”


At that moment, Kwon-ma’s eyes trembled slightly. No one had ever asked him so directly. Not only his fellow demons, but even his father did not treat the demons rudely.


“I guess this is how you tricked all the Amazons, but it won’t work on me.”




It seems that being told that he looked tired touched his feelings.


“As I said, that’s not what I wanted in the first place. I have other wishes.”


“Something?”


“Please teach me martial arts. Learning martial arts is so much fun. I get so excited and thrilled that I can’t sleep.”


It was a sincere remark. Perhaps it was because he had trained in swordsmanship his entire life. Perhaps it was because he had achieved the twelve great successes of the Bicheon Sword Technique. Perhaps it was because he had achieved the great success of the Wind God Four Treasures. It was a martial art that came to him like fate at exactly this time.


“Please teach me. I want to fight you with the martial arts you taught me!”


“!”


“I want to beat the master with that technique.”


In that moment, a wave of energy poured out from Kwonma’s body. Kwonma’s prayer was like the wind. It was a prayer where you couldn’t open your eyes because of the strong wind, and your mind went blank because of the fear of being blown away somewhere.


The Cheonmahoshinkong was naturally activated and the Hosinganggi was also raised to counter his prayer.


Then, Kwonma’s prayer became even more powerful. A wind blew that seemed to blow away not only his body but also his soul.


I injected my inner strength into my clenched fist and unleashed a single attack.


It was a martial art learned in the training of the enemy, one fist against heaven.


Pfft!


A cool breeze blew from the air where my fist had landed.

I said, staring into Kwonma’s eyes.


“The Master has awakened something inside me.”


Even if I don’t say it, Kwonma will know what it is.


Kwonma asked me as he took back the prayer that had been pressuring me.


“Why did you come here only now?”


The seventh of the eight Amazons. It was a question he would be curious about.


“Wasn’t I someone you needed that much?”


“It’s the opposite.”


“You object?”


“I heard that you play the role of two demon lords. That’s why I wanted to meet you when I became stronger.”


“Who said I play two roles?”


“It’s my father.”


My father said that the number of demons was four to three, but it was tight. I confirmed through the horse riding that he had the horse in mind.


It is clear that the father has some influence on the demons. Kwon Ma also showed somewhat complicated emotions when his father was mentioned.


“I can’t believe the leader said something like that. Don’t try to force me to your side.”


“Go and check it out.”


Kwon Ma’s face has become even scarier. I can guarantee that if you go out to the Central Plains with that face, every day will be a series of fun events with new incidents.


He asked me, staring at me menacingly.


“Are you serious about saying that you can become my disciple?”


“I’m serious. This is your only chance to become the master of the Heavenly Demon. Don’t miss it.”




“What are you going to do if you try to control the disciple who has become a Heavenly Horse?”


Finally, I too began to pray. It was the first time I had ever revealed my prayer to Kwonma.


The vast, endless sky.


The clear water reflecting the sky. The bottomless deep sea that you realize after dipping your feet in the shallow-looking water. He spoke sternly, stretching out that suffocating fear.


“Is your heavenly horse just that kind of person?”


Kwonma looked at me with a surprised face.


We stared at each other for a long time in silence. It was Kwon-ma who broke the long silence.


“Put your hand out. Put your hand out, baby.”


I put my hand forward.


“Clench your fist.”


I slowly clenched my fist.


A strange light flashed through Kwonma’s eyes as he examined my fist. Yes, it wouldn’t be an easy hand to see. This hand that you call a baby’s hand was a heavenly, heavenly hand.


To become a master, the whole body is important, but especially the hands are important. This is especially important in martial arts, because the weaknesses of the body cannot be hidden by weapons.


He took my hand in his large one, and our hands met and explored each other.


After a while, Kwonma turned around and walked away without saying anything about my hand.


“Come to the black fist training starting tomorrow.”


\* \* \*


After leaving Donggwonmun, I went straight to Akingok.


It was to ask the evil Soma about Kwonma. For some reason, I thought the evil Soma would know Kwonma well.


As always, the evil Soma was sitting blankly in that completely white room.




His first words when he saw me were these.


“Lee Gongja, I want to fight Kwon Ma.”


I was surprised.


“Have you mastered the art of mind reading? Or have we become close enough to know each other’s minds just by looking at each other’s eyes?”


“You’re wearing a mask today, aren’t you?”


“If you wear a mask, do you want to fight the demon?”


“Yes, then I want to fight Kwonma.”


I smiled and pulled the mask over my head.


“Would you like to come like this?”


“Then you must have come here to play with me.”


At least I wasn’t here to play today, so I put my mask back on.


“You can fool ghosts, but you can’t fool Soma-sama.”


I nodded and admitted it honestly.


“Do you miss blood?”


“I think so. When I miss blood, the first thing that comes to mind is Soma-sama.”


“I heard that Lee Gong-ja was learning martial arts from Kwon Ma, so I thought he would come to see me someday.”


The evil Soma and the evil Kwonma were completely different people. Their feelings, their atmosphere, their personalities, everything.


However, if you were to classify the demons without any criteria, it would seem that the evil demons and the powerful demons would be in the same category.


“Do you know why Kwonma supports the Grand Duke?”


“I’m late.”




The evil Soma shook his head.


“Do you support primogeniture?”


“That’s not true.”


“Then why do you support your brother?”


Then an unexpected answer came out.


“It must be because of the leader.”


“Because of your father?”


“Before the recent rise of the Duke of Yi, everyone expected the Grand Duke to be the successor. The leader of the sect probably had the same intention at the time.”


“Does that mean that Kwon-ma is following his father’s will?”


“That’s right. They probably think that the leader wants the Grand Duke as his successor. They don’t realize that things have changed a lot these days.”


“Because I was only focused on teaching my subordinates.”


“That’s right. If the cult leader finds out that you have a disciple in mind, he will change his mind.”


Chwima said that his father would like Kwonma the most because he was purely crazy about martial arts. He thought that maybe Kwonma was the one who liked his father the most.


The evil Soma gave Kwonma some final advice.


“Kwon-ma’s nickname is undefeated. He is a man who has never lost. You will know what kind of man Kwon-ma is when he loses.”


I nodded silently. Maybe I’ll be the one to give that first card.


The evil Soma read my passion like that.


“Lee Gongja, why do you want to become so strong?”


He knew exactly that his ultimate goal in learning martial arts from Kwon Ma was not to obtain the Demon Lord, but rather to become stronger.


“Are you dreaming of the unification of the world?”




“no.”


I said firmly.


“Do you want to become the best in the world?”


“That’s not it either.”


“Then why are you running so breathlessly?”


“I have a feeling that a formidable opponent will appear before me one day. A formidable opponent that I can never defeat unless I work like crazy. I guess I have that kind of anxiety.”


I honestly revealed my anxiety to him. Strangely, it was comfortable for the evil Soma to reveal such feelings.


The evil Soma, who had been quietly staring at me, suddenly let out a gust of wind.


Geeeeeeek.


On the white wall he always looked at, a long line was drawn by the wind. I was surprised. It was a line drawn on a wall that seemed like it would never be damaged.


“Lee Gongja, how far have we come?”


It’s been a long time since he drew a line and asked me. The last time I drew it, I said I had reached the survival line.


I pulled out my black magic sword and drew a vertical line along the last part of the line, passing the line of survival I had drawn before.


“I have come this far.”


I didn’t spend much time with him, but two fights where we fought back to back and risked our lives drew the line here.


“Do you remember? When we first met, I told you that I would not be friends with a masked person. Now, the rule has changed. Since I wear a mask, I will be friends with a masked person.”


The evil Soma spoke to me with clear eyes.


“That’s what the scholar said. When you get to that point, you become friends, and you eat and drink together. You have fun and fight together. If you’re in danger, you go to save them. And if someone dies first, you pour alcohol on their grave.”


“you’re right.”


“If a formidable enemy like the one I mentioned earlier appears and puts Lee Gongja in danger… … .”


After a moment, the evil Soma added:


“I will go and rescue you.”


“!”


I could tell. The path of the evil soma was drawn in the same place as me.


My father always tells me not to trust people. He says that this kind of feeling is a cheap emotion that is easy to die for. He says that it is a naive emotion. But even so, I love this moment so much.


“I will wait for you to save me.”


The eyes of the evil soma shone brightly. There was no need for further words.


As I was about to turn around and leave, I asked the evil Soma with concern.


“By the way, is that wall okay? It’s a wall for training, isn’t it?”


It was said that if you practice while looking at a white wall, you will gain more internal energy. However, worried about what would happen if you damaged it, the evil soma looked at the white wall on the other side and said.


“I don’t like the color of that wall. From today on, let’s look at this wall.”
