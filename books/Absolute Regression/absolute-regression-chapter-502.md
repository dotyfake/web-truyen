## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Seo Dae-ryong cảm động khi Jang-ho gọi mình là "bạn nhậu quý giá". Anh hứa sẽ mời Jang-ho một chầu sau khi trở về và nhớ về những ngày tháng muốn trở thành một trinh thám giống như Jang-ho. Cả hai cùng nhớ về Ian và mong muốn được cùng nhau uống rượu trên hòn đảo không người ở.

Tiếng vũ khí va chạm và tiếng la hét kéo họ trở về thực tại. Seo Dae-ryong lo lắng cho thuộc hạ nhưng Jang-ho trấn an rằng họ là những người mạnh mẽ, được rèn luyện qua gian khổ. Jang-ho tin tưởng tuyệt đối vào thuộc hạ của Ma Giáo (Demon Lord). Seo Dae-ryong nhận ra suy nghĩ mà mình nên có đối với những điều tra viên và chấp pháp giả của Hoàng Thiên Các (Hwangcheon Pavilion). Anh thầm quyết tâm sẽ huấn luyện họ trong địa ngục sau khi trở về. Seo Dae-ryong cũng rút ra được bài học từ trận chiến với đám người đeo mặt nạ, đặc biệt là về việc kiểm soát nội lực.

Trên đường đi, Seo Dae-ryong than thở với Jang-ho về việc liên tục bị bao vây bởi người của Ma Giáo.

Trong khi đó, Giáo Chủ (king) dẫn đầu thuộc hạ chiến đấu với đám người đeo mặt nạ. Ông ta tức giận khi thấy có kẻ tấn công từ phía sau, và phát hiện ra đó là một võ giả mặc đồng phục của Võ Lâm Minh (Martial Arts Alliance). Đúng lúc nguy cấp, một đại hán của Ma Giáo đã cứu người này. Hóa ra, có hai loại người tấn công Trung Kê Chỉ Đàn (Junggyejidan): những kẻ đeo mặt nạ và những kẻ giả dạng thành viên Võ Lâm Minh. Quân Ma Giáo nhanh chóng tiêu diệt những kẻ đeo mặt nạ, bỏ mặc những kẻ giả dạng.

Jeong-hyeok của Ma Binh Đoàn (Demon Corps) nhận thấy võ công của các đại hán Ma Giáo không hề thua kém các tinh nhuệ của Ma Binh Đoàn. Ju-Gwol bị phân tâm bởi trận chiến và suýt bị tấn công từ phía sau, nhưng Jang-ho đã kịp thời cứu ông ta. Quân Ma Giáo nhanh chóng dọn dẹp chiến trường, giúp Võ Lâm Minh truy tìm và tiêu diệt những kẻ ẩn nấp.

Sau khi dọn dẹp xong, Ju-gwol bày tỏ lòng biết ơn với Jang-ho. Seo Dae-ryong xen vào, khẳng định rằng những kẻ tấn công mình không phải người của Ma Giáo. Ju-gwol nghi ngờ nhưng Jang-ho xác nhận điều này. Seo Dae-ryong cho rằng có kẻ muốn gây chia rẽ giữa họ. Ju-gwol ra lệnh xác minh danh tính của những người đã chết và yêu cầu Seo Dae-ryong ở lại cho đến khi sự thật được phơi bày. Jang-ho hứa sẽ ở lại bảo vệ Seo Dae-ryong cho đến khi Diệt Ma Quân Chủ (Demon Slayer Lord) trở về. Ju-gwol lo lắng cho Jin Ha-gun, nhưng Seo Dae-ryong trấn an rằng mọi chuyện sẽ ổn vì có người đã theo Jin Ha-gun, thậm chí bỏ cả cánh tay phải.

Ở một nơi khác, Geommu-geuk và Jin Ha-gun đang đứng trong rừng, quan sát Hương Thủy Sơn Trang (Hyangsu Mountain Villa). Jin Ha-gun giải thích rằng họ đang bí mật điều tra sơn trang này để tìm kiếm vị thương nhân nổi tiếng mất tích và gia đình ông ta. Anh ta phát hiện ra một thành viên của địa phương đã mua một lượng lớn thảo dược để chữa trị vết thương, và sau đó tìm thấy sơn trang này.

Một thuộc hạ báo cáo rằng Trùng Khánh Địa Khu (Chungking District) bị tấn công. Jin Ha-gun tức giận và lo lắng cho Seo Dae-ryong. Anh ta hỏi về tù nhân trong não ngục (brain prison) và được báo rằng người đó vẫn an toàn. Jin Ha-gun thầm cảm ơn Jang-ho và Ma Gun.

Geommu-geuk nghi ngờ về thời điểm vị tướng nổi tiếng xuất hiện, cho rằng đây có thể là một cái bẫy. Tuy nhiên, Geommu-geuk cũng không loại trừ khả năng đây là một âm mưu thực sự. Anh ta cho rằng mục tiêu thực sự có thể là cái chết của Diệt Ma Quân Chủ (Demon Slayer). Geommu-geuk suy đoán rằng những sự kiện trước đó, như việc Huyết Thiên Ma (Blood Heavenly Demon) phá hủy các môn phái, có thể là sự chuẩn bị cho cái chết của Jin Ha-gun. Nếu Jin Ha-gun chết, Thiên Ma Thần Giáo (Cheonma Shingyo) cũng sẽ nổi giận vì đồ đệ của Huyết Thiên Ma đã chết trong quá trình điều tra. Geommu-geuk cho rằng có thể có người đang chờ đợi ở sơn trang để giết Jin Ha-gun và Ma Binh Đoàn.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-501/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-503/)502  

Even if he had just called me a drinking buddy, I would have been touched, but Jang-ho added the word ‘precious’.




Seo Dae-ryong was moved. The unexpected emotion that a blunt person sometimes gives has several times the original power.


It was a really inappropriate thing to say in this situation where the blood from the dead masked man’s body was flowing towards Jang-ho and his own legs.


“I’ll buy you a drink when I get back.”


I wanted to drink all night at a tavern like Jang-ho.


Seo Dae-ryong had liked Jang-ho since long ago. He looked cool when he sat there silently drinking. Even the scars on his face made him look even cooler.


If I think about it, Jang-ho was like a milestone for me, who wanted to become a detective.


‘I want to become a drone like this too.’


Rather, the leader of the sect was not a suitable person in this regard.


Because Geommugeuk was doing things that he could not even dare to imitate. The path he was walking was one that ordinary people could never follow.


So, Jangho could actually be a more realistic goal for Seo Dae-ryong.




“It would be nice if we could come together on this uninhabited island.”


When Jang Ho mentioned Ian, Seo Dae Ryong also missed her.


“That’s right. Where are you and what are you doing?”


But one thing is for sure: she is growing every day.


“When we return to this uninhabited island later, we’ll have a lot to talk about all night long. Us too, on this uninhabited island.”


The fantasy they had spread out for a moment was over, and the two returned to reality.


From a distance, the sound of weapons clashing together was heard, followed by screams.


Seo Dae-ryong was startled and shouted.


“Shouldn’t we go quickly?”


“Yes, let’s go.”




“I’m worried that the luggage might have been hurt.”


Unlike Seo Dae-ryong, who was anxious and wanted to run away right away, Jang-ho was calm. He didn’t rush. After all, the main goal of the demon army today was to protect Seo Dae-ryong.


And Jangho believed.


The owners of those screams I hear are all enemies.


Their large size was not achieved simply by eating a lot of food.


Because it was created through the accumulation of hard work, arduous training, and practical experience gained while running around the battlefield.


“It’ll be okay, we’re demons.”


Pride in the Demon Lord, and absolute trust in his subordinates.


Seo Dae-ryong was now directly observing what his final thoughts should be towards the Hwangcheon-gak investigators and enforcers.


“The weaklings of our Hwangcheon Pavilion, when we return, all of you will begin your training in hell.”




Of course, I will take the lead in practicing it myself.


I learned a lot from fighting the masked men today.


It was good when I used the Mysterious Blood Wind that required a huge amount of internal energy, but in the final fight, I almost died because I didn’t have enough internal energy. I had a proper experience of how failure to control internal energy can lead to death.


‘I train so hard that I almost die! I sleep until I’m dead!’


As he was walking away from there, demons surrounded Seodaeryong.


Among the large bodies, Seodaeryong spoke to Jangho while lifting his crow’s feet.


“Yesterday I was surrounded by demon lords, today I am surrounded by demons. Have you ever seen a life like this?”


\* \* \*


The king did not spare his body.


He fought at the forefront against the masked men. Although he was dissatisfied with Jin Ha-gun and made poor judgments, at least his loyalty to Maeng and his care for his subordinates were no less than anyone else’s.


Phew!


The sword of the lord pierced the masked man’s neck. Without even having time to wipe the blood that splattered on his face, he struck down the dark spirit that flew towards him with his sword.


He is a man who did not seek the position of the leader of the Murim Alliance through bribery or flattery.


“Watch out for the back! Block the left!”


He used evil to command his subordinates and took the lead in fighting the enemies.


The king couldn’t believe it. How could they attack when there were so many guards?


‘You crazy demonic bastards!’


The lord was certain that the enemies were the demons. If it weren’t for the Demonic Cult, there would be no one who would dare do such a thing.


Also, the fact that the Demonic Cult attacked the Martial Arts Alliance is tantamount to starting a war.


Ju-Gwol shouted at the Zidane warrior who was fighting the masked man in front of him.




“be careful!”


Someone was stabbing him from behind. Surprisingly, it wasn’t a masked man, but a martial artist wearing the same martial arts alliance uniform.


It was too late to avoid the situation.


Crash! Crash! Crash!


The ribs of the unmanned man who had been attacking from behind were shattered and he rolled on the ground. The large unmanned man rushed in in an instant and hit the masked man with his large torso, sending him flying.


How can such a big guy be this fast?


The demons were showing a movement that completely broke the stereotype that skinny people are fast.


In the distance, another demon could be seen flying nimbly into the air, swinging his sword.


The masked man who was swinging his sword from the tree fell down along with the severed branch.


There were two types of people who raided the Junggyejidan today. Those wearing masks and those disguised in the martial arts league uniforms.


‘These cowards!’


They killed the Murim Alliance warriors by surprise attacking them from behind while wearing Murim Alliance uniforms.


It was possible to disguise it like this because the unmanned personnel who had come to support from various branches and wards were staying together, making it difficult to determine exactly who was who.


At first, they were constantly attacked by these cowardly foes, but things changed when the demons joined the fight.


The demons quickly began to eliminate the masked men first. They didn’t even bother to track down those disguised as allies, and instead just caught and killed the masked men.

The martial arts skills of the demon lords were on a different level from those of ordinary warriors.


Jeonghyeok of the Demon Corps, who was fighting alongside them, confirmed that their martial arts were not inferior at all to the elite warriors of the Demon Corps. In fact, many of them showed movements that were one step ahead.


That was to be expected, as the demons who came here were the most skilled among the demons.


At that moment, Ju-Gwol was momentarily distracted by the fight between the demon lords.


Shhhhh.


At that moment, he twisted his body as an attack flew in from behind. He despaired.


‘It’s late!’


Phew!


The tip of the enemy’s sword, dressed in the martial arts league’s attire, stopped in front of his face. As the warrior who had swung his sword fell, Jangho stood behind him.


“Thank you.”


He had saved his men when the rain of secret weapons had poured down before, but this time he had saved himself.


Jang-ho simply nodded his head at his touching greeting.


The demons who had come with Jangho all flew away at once. As they joined in, the inside of the room was cleared even faster.


Once all the masked people running wild here and there were eliminated, it wasn’t difficult to track down the hidden enemies.


“Everyone, gather by branch!”


As the martial artists of the Murim Alliance gathered together, those who had been disguised began to be revealed.


The martial arts alliance and the demon army quickly eliminated them by joining forces. It was difficult to capture them alive. Those who failed to escape committed suicide by cutting their own throats. Judging from the fact that there was no hesitation in making that decision, they were truly well-trained.


So all the enemies were either killed or escaped from there.


The martial artists of the Murim Alliance began to clean up the place. They took the injured to the hospital and began to gather the dead in one place.


Ju-gwol sighed. If it weren’t for these large, unmanned people, the damage would have been really severe, but they managed to stop it with minimal damage.




Ju-gwol expressed his gratitude to Jang-ho.


“Thanks to you, we were able to stop the attack from the demonic cult.”


At that time, Seo Dae-ryong stepped forward.


“Those who surprised me today weren’t mine. Can’t you tell by the fact that they tried to kill me?”


Ju-gwol looked at Jang-ho. Jang-ho nodded and answered with a look that seemed to ask if that was true.


“I really tried to kill this guy.”


Could it be a fabrication? He tried to swallow the words that were rising to his throat. He still thought it was the work of the Demonic Cult. It was too vulgar and bold an attack to deny.


If not for the Demonic Cult, who in the world would be able to attack a base full of martial arts leaders?


“Then who the hell are these people?”


Seo Dae-ryong answered the king’s question calmly.


“They must be the ones trying to cause discord between you and us.”


The king sighed lightly and then gave orders to his subordinates.


“First, thoroughly verify the identities of the dead.”


“All right.”


The king said to Seo Dae-ryong.


“You cannot leave until the truth behind what happened today is revealed.”


“Even if you tell me to leave, I have no intention of leaving.”


Anyway, I had to stay here until the sword dance came back.


Jangho said to him.


“We will stay and guard until the Demon Slayer Lord returns.”




“I would appreciate it if you could do that.”


Because he owed Jangho his life, Ju-gwol’s gaze toward Jang-ho was gentle.


Ju-gwol spoke worriedly to Jeong-hyeok of the Myeolma-dae.


“I’m worried if the Lord is okay.”


They are the ones who are attacking the Moorim Alliance’s base, so Jin Ha-gun is worried.


Then Seo Dae-ryong spoke with a strange smile. Of course, it was something Ju-gwol could not understand.


“I think it will be okay since there is someone who followed me, even abandoning his right arm.”


\* \* \*


“There it is.”


There was a garden where Jin Ha-gun was looking.


Now, Geommu-geuk and Jin Ha-gun were standing side by side in the forest far from the garden.


It was so far away that I had to use my new eyesight to see the letters on the sign hanging on the gate.


Hyangsu Mountain Villa.


It was a mountain lodge located in a secluded place far from the author.


“We are currently conducting a secret investigation into that mountain lodge. We will bring you the results of the investigation soon.”


Geommugeuk asked about Jin Hagun’s explanation.


“How did you know that a famous person was being held here?”


“As you know, we are currently searching Chongqing thoroughly to find the missing famous merchant and his family.”


Since not a single body was found in the cemetery, hopes were high that they might be alive.


“There were more than a few people there that day. That’s why I ordered all the members of the National Assembly to be monitored.”




I thought that if they got injured, I could buy a large quantity of medicine to treat them.


“Then I found out that someone in the local council had bought a large quantity of herbs to treat injuries.”


It was the news that the searchers had been waiting for so long.


“Considering the type and quantity of herbs, it could have been used to treat the people of the famous store. So I searched all the surrounding areas and found this mountain lodge. And I found out that there was a warrior who belonged to the famous store there.”


Then there was no reason to worry any longer. No matter what the circumstances, since the famous Jang Muin had shown up, it became necessary to investigate that place.


“We hope that the famous general and his family are alive. Now, let’s launch a rescue operation as soon as possible.”


“Is this really a rescue operation?”


It was clear why Geommugeuk was suspicious of this situation.


“Why did the famous general show up at such a coincidental time when Seo Joo-ju was captured by you?”


Of course, Jin Ha-gun was also suspicious of this coincidence, but it was the only clue that led to the famous general. He had to set up a trap.


At that time, a subordinate of the Demon King came and quickly reported one fact.


“They say the Chungking District was attacked.”


Jin Ha-gun was surprised. He had expected it to some extent, but he didn’t think Zidane would actually be attacked.


“What happened?”


“On our side, they say dozens of people were killed or injured.”


Jin Ha-gun’s impression hardened. He was furious. The accident had happened while he and the Extermination Corps were away. What if this was a trick? What if there was nothing in that mountain lodge?


“Who was held captive in the brain prison?”


“They said he was safe.”


The sword dance I was listening to was a relief. I sent Jangho and Magun, but I didn’t know what variables would come into play in the world of martial arts.


“What about the enemies?”




“They say they killed them all.”


Jin Ha-gun looked at the sword dance. Judging from the fact that Seo Dae-ryong did not die despite the surprise attack and the report that all the enemies had been defeated, he guessed that the demon army had played a big role.


“Your judgment was correct. Thank you.”


If it weren’t for the support of the demons, the damage would have been incomparable to what it is now. As always, the insight of this cult leader does not betray faith.


“Then this place must have been created to lure us.”


He thought that he had been lured here by using the famous general who had been kept alive.


But Geommugeuk thought differently.


“Maybe not.”


Jin Ha-gun looked at Geommu-geuk with an expression that asked what he meant.


“What if this is a real conspiracy?”


Geommugeuk conveyed his thoughts.


“There won’t be a war just because Jidan was attacked. The school and the Murim Alliance aren’t that weak. But what about this? The investigation into the destruction of the famous sect and the Daejungmun clan… .”


The swordsman added after a brief pause.


“Death of the Demon Slayer.”


It was a problem of a different level from the simple problem of Jidan being attacked. He was the grandson of the leader of the martial arts world and a strong candidate to become the next leader of the martial arts world.


“What if the events that happened before were preparations for your death?”


A disciple of Blood Heavenly Demon destroys the famous sect and the Daejungmun, and the Demon Lord who was investigating the incident ends up dying at the hands of the Demonic Cult. What if that’s how the story was made up?


Jin Ha-gun looked at Geommu-geuk with a surprised face. In addition, the Cheonma Shingyo would also be angry. After all, the disciple of the Blood Heavenly Demon was dragged to the Moorim Alliance for investigation and died.


There will be a day when both sides talk, and what if they try another trick?


“If my prediction is correct… … .”


The deep gaze of the swordsman turned towards the silent Jangwon.


“There will be someone waiting there who can kill you and the Demon Squad.”
