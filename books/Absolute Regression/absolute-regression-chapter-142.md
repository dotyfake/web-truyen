# Absolute Regression Chapter 142 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Chusaeng (Thu Sinh), môn chủ (Wolpungmunju) của Wolpungmun (Vô Phong Môn), cố gắng kìm nén cơn giận khi nghe anh trai Seokhyung (Thạch Hình) trấn an rằng các môn phái ở Honam (Hồ Nam) hứa sẽ hợp tác. Anh tức giận vì không ai thực sự đứng ra giúp đỡ cụ thể, bởi vì tin đồn về việc Ma Giáo (Demonic Cult) nhúng tay đã lan truyền. Chusaeng lo sợ rằng các môn phái khác sẽ lợi dụng tình hình để kiểm soát Wolpungmun.

Chusaeng muốn tìm đến Võ Lâm Minh (Murim Alliance) để được giúp đỡ, nhưng lo sợ bị thao túng. Đúng lúc đó, một người trẻ tuổi xuất hiện và nói: "Các người không muốn bị kẻ chỉ biết lấy tiền mà không cho lại gì điều khiển, đúng chứ?".

Người lạ mặt tự xưng là đến từ "tôn giáo mới", hắn lẻn vào vì không thích đám đông. Chusaeng, sau khi biết người lạ mặt không có ý định xấu, liền hỏi danh tính, nhưng người này từ chối tiết lộ và chỉ nói đến để giải quyết vụ việc ở Guipa (Quỷ Bá), đồng thời đưa ra một thánh bài có khắc hình ác quỷ.

Chusaeng nghi ngờ nên ra lệnh cho Seokhyung tấn công. Người lạ mặt dễ dàng khống chế Seokhyung bằng ma pháp, khiến Chusaeng phải ra lệnh dừng lại. Người lạ mặt nói rằng kỹ năng có thể thay thế địa vị, và cảnh báo cả hai người không nên hành động thiếu suy nghĩ. Chusaeng ra lệnh cho Seokhyung rời đi để tập hợp các cao thủ của Wolpungmun.

Chusaeng hỏi người lạ mặt về mục đích của hắn. Người lạ mặt nói rằng hắn đến để điều tra, không phải trả thù, và sự việc trước đó không phải do họ gây ra. Chusaeng không tin và cho rằng Thiên Mệnh Hội (Cheonmyeonghoe) đã mạo danh người của hắn để gây ra chuyện này.

Người lạ mặt yêu cầu Chusaeng kể lại mọi chuyện. Chusaeng kể rằng gần đây có một người đến, tự xưng là đã rời khỏi giáo phái, và hắn là một ác tăng (evil Soma). Người này đeo mặt nạ trắng và giết chết các cao thủ của Wolpungmun trong nháy mắt, sau đó ép họ quy phục Ma Giáo và cống nạp tiền bạc. Tổng số tiền bị cướp là 62,000 lượng. Chusaeng vô cùng tức giận vì quân mình chết vô ích chỉ vì tiền.

Người lạ mặt bật cười và hỏi Chusaeng về đặc điểm của người kia. Anh ta nhận ra rằng kẻ mạo danh đã bắt chước các chiêu thức độc ác của Cực Ác Tăng (extremely evil Soma) như Magikwangbokjang (Ma Khí Quang Bộc Trượng) và Blood Angji (Huyết Án Chỉ). Người lạ mặt cho rằng Cực Ác Tăng không đời nào lại đi ăn cướp tiền như vậy.

Người lạ mặt hỏi Chusaeng tại sao lại được chọn làm mục tiêu. Hắn nói rằng mình đến để tìm hiểu chuyện gì đang xảy ra, và yêu cầu Chusaeng cho hắn biết lý do tại sao Wolpungmun lại bị nhắm đến. Chusaeng ra lệnh dọn dẹp phòng khách và đối đãi với người lạ mặt như một vị khách quý. Chusaeng thừa nhận rằng anh ta đang bám víu vào hy vọng cuối cùng và cầu xin tổ tiên phù hộ. Anh ta nói rằng vì người lạ mặt, anh ta đã bước lên con đường báo thù không thể quay đầu lại. Người lạ mặt hứa sẽ giúp anh ta vượt qua con đường đó.

Người lạ mặt đi quanh đại sảnh, nhớ lại cảnh tượng người của Wolpungmun bị giết và tiền bạc bị cướp đi. Anh ta suy nghĩ về lý do của hành động này: vì tiền hay để kéo họ vào cuộc? Anh ta hỏi Chusaeng rằng nếu là để gây hấn với Võ Lâm Minh, thì tại sao lại không tấn công các môn phái thuộc chính phái?

Người lạ mặt đến gần Chusaeng, nhìn thẳng vào mắt anh ta và hỏi: "Chắc chắn phải có lý do tại sao họ lại chọn cậu. Tại sao lại là cậu? Cậu còn trẻ, sáng dạ, nóng tính và kiêu hãnh. Ngoài những gì được viết trên mảnh giấy này, cậu còn có gì khác?".

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-141/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-143/)The answer to the 142nd question is in your hands.




Wolpungmunju Chusaeng (秋生) was trying hard to suppress his boiling anger.


“Don’t worry too much. Several sects in Honam have promised to cooperate with us.”


It was these words that made him angry. He was even angrier when they came from the mouth of his trusted older brother.


“Cooperation? How? Be specific. How many people will you send, when, and where?”


Seok-hyung couldn’t answer. He only said that he would help, but no sect had specifically stepped forward. Even though he kept it a secret, rumors of the Demonic Cult’s involvement were already spreading.


“Think about us in their shoes. Would we have sent you to deal with the demonic cult? On the outside, they’d pretend to be concerned, but they’d be busy locking down our house.”


Chuseng suddenly stood up. Seokhyung stopped him because he looked like he was going to break something at any moment.


“Fix it.”


“How can I hold back my anger? You devilish bastards! I’ll eat you alive!”


Bam!




Chusaeng threw a knife and made a hole in the wall. Since the incident, there were already more than twenty holes in the wall. If you block it, more will be made, and if you block it, more will be made.


Chuseng was so angry and resentful. Chimi couldn’t hold back her anger. And at the root of all those emotions was fear.


I’m afraid he’ll come back again.


Chuseng couldn’t sleep at night and his nerves were extremely sensitive.


“Please ask the Murim Alliance for help right now.”


The Wolpungmun was originally a sect of the Jeongsaji clan and was not affiliated with the Murim Alliance or the Sadomaeng.


“If we do that, we’ll be manipulated by the Murim Alliance in the future. If they solve this problem, they’ll use that as an excuse to unconditionally submit to the Murim Alliance, and even if they can’t solve it, they’ll use various excuses to make us submit to the Murim Alliance.”


The sects belonging to the Murim Alliance had to pay a set amount of money to the Murim Alliance every year. This was the same for the Cheonma Shingyo and the Sadomaeng. In return, they could receive help when problems arose.


Money is money, but Chusaeng didn’t want to belong to a political party.


It was at that moment that someone spoke his mind exactly.




“You wouldn’t want to be under someone who always takes your money without giving you anything in return, would you?”


Chuseng and Seokhyung were startled and looked back. A young man had entered the main hall.


Seok-hyung drew his sword and stood between Moon-joo and the man.


“Who are you?”


The two were nervous that they hadn’t noticed until someone came in like this.


Then the young man said,


“I came from the new religion.”


It was I who startled those two people.


I could have announced it from the entrance and come in, but I didn’t do that. Right now, the Wolpungmun was in a chaotic state with countless unmanned people swarming from the entrance to the inside.


“Please understand. I came in quietly because I don’t like crowds.”




Chuseng pushed Seokhyung back. If I had planned a surprise attack, it would mean that they had already admitted that they were dead.


“I am Chu Saeng, the head of the Wolpungmun clan.”


Having lost his father at an early age, he was one of the youngest leaders of the sect in Honam Province, in his late twenties.


I didn’t reveal my identity to him.


“I came here to deal with the incident that occurred in Guipa this time. I cannot reveal my identity due to the circumstances, but you will understand this, right?”


He showed them a sacred plaque with an evil spirit symbolizing the church engraved on it.


Naturally, Chusaeng was suspicious from the start.


“The divine seal can be forged, so you can’t trust it alone.”


“How could such a suspicious person be fooled by them?”


“You are talking too much!”


As Seok-hyung took a step forward, I reached out my hand.


Swish.


The magic that came out of me squeezed Seok-hyung’s body.


He couldn’t move his body except for a single scream, “Groan.” His face turned red as he gasped for breath.


“Isn’t it true that sometimes skills can replace status?”


Chuseng spoke urgently to the magic that had taken control of the surroundings.


“Stop! I lost several of my men this time, and I can’t lose them again. Let that man go.”


As I gathered up the magic, Seok-hyung was able to move while holding his breath. He glared at me with fearful eyes, but he still stood in front of me to protect Chu-saeng.


“I have loyal subordinates like you. If I were to lose them, my heart would truly break. The same would happen to you here, Chu Moon-ju. So you two should not act rashly.”


I said this to Seok-hyung, but in fact, I also said this to Chu-saeng. Chu-saeng, who was quick-witted, sent Seok-hyung away.




“You stay out.”


“yes.”


In this situation, seeing them leave obediently, it seems that they have sent a telegram. Since the two of them alone cannot deal with me anyway, it must have been an order to go out and gather all the masters of the Wolpungmun.


Even though there were only two left, Chusaeng was confident.


“When you did something, you did it, and now you’re trying to clean it up. What on earth are your intentions?”


“This is an investigation, not a training. The incident that happened earlier wasn’t something we did.”


Chuseng snorted. He was taken advantage of by Cheonmyeonghoe, who was impersonating the head of the school, and he believed that it was our fault.


Although similar incidents have occurred several times recently, not all of the Central Plains sects are aware of this fact.


That is, it was a time when the Cheonmyeonghoe had not yet fully surfaced.


“Tell me what happened. If I had come here to harm you, would we be arguing like this now?”


As if those words had sunk in, Chusaeng finally opened his mouth to talk about the past incident.


“A person came to me recently, saying he had left the church.”


“Who did you say it was?”


“He was a very evil soma.”


I knew they were impersonating Amazon, but I didn’t know they were targeting the evil Soma.

I couldn’t help but laugh out loud. If I get caught by a truly evil soma, why do I pretend to be an evil soma instead of someone else?


“What does it look like?”


“I came wearing a white mask.”


Well, since he’s wearing a mask, the easiest Amazon to impersonate would be the evil Soma.


“Did you believe him because he wore a mask?”


Then Chusaeng said with confidence.


“He was a truly evil soma.”


“Why do you believe that?”


At that moment, Chusaeng was overcome with anger.


“He killed the masters of the text in an instant. His wind blast pierced their faces, and his long swordsmanship tore their bodies apart and scattered them. Among the dead were some of the three best masters of the text. If he is not the most evil soma, then who on earth is he?”


It seems that he has imitated the extremely evil Soma’s poisonous magic, the Magikwangbokjang, and even the Blood Angji. Given the circumstances, Chuseng had no choice but to believe him.


“After killing those who tried to protect me and turning them into a sea of blood, the evil Soma forced us to submit to the Demonic Cult and swear allegiance to them.”


He committed unnecessary killings just to scare his opponents. For that act alone, he is an evil who deserves to die.


“And do you know what he did next? If he had just massacred us, it would have been less absurd than it is now. We would have thought, ‘What an unlucky person he is,’”


“What did he do?”


“He took my money before he left. He demanded all the money I could give him. He took all the money in the text. What are you guys doing when you are just stealing!”


It was a situation where I could understand whatever curses were thrown at me afterwards.


“How much money did you take?”


“It will cost about sixty-two thousand nyang.”


Now I could understand Chuseng’s anger. I could also understand why there were so many holes in the wall.




“Rather, if I had lost the fight for another reason, I wouldn’t feel so wronged. To submit to the Demonic Cult? Don’t make me laugh! That’s just an excuse, and he killed my men like that to steal my money. Do you know what I mean? My men died just for money! You could have just asked for money from the beginning!”


He couldn’t stand it anymore and screamed.


“Aaaah! I’m so angry I can’t stand it. I won’t die in exile.”


Judging from what Chuseng said, I thought he must have been a cheerful and happy person. If this continues, he will never be able to return to that time. The families of the dead, their friends, and those who survived. The number of victims has not yet been determined.


“Right now, His Majesty the King is so angry that he can’t use his strengths.”


“What are my strengths!”


I took the paper out of my pocket and read it.


“Wolpungmunju Chusaeng, he is intelligent and has good judgment. He has strong pride and a choleric side.”


“Who made that assessment?”


“This is the Honam branch of the main branch of our school. Would you like to meet up with me?”


Chusaeng looked at me with eyes that seemed to be wondering whether he should believe this or not, then reproached himself in a tired tone.


“What good is being clear-headed and having good judgment? I was just helpless and suffered like this.”


“But shouldn’t we get revenge?”


Chusaeng’s eyes hardened at the word revenge.


“I will do it, I will definitely do it.”


There was a time when I felt the same way.


Revenge while sleeping, revenge while eating, revenge when seeing someone. A time when I couldn’t live a normal life because the only thought in my head was how to get revenge.


The same goes for Chuseng. He is an enemy that cannot be dealt with through normal means.


But fortunately, just as I met Seojin, he met me.


“I will help you with that revenge.”




Chusaeng went to the table and drank the cold tea straight from the kettle.


“Isn’t this really your doing?”


“Don’t you think something is strange? If the truly evil Soma had been after your money, would he have only taken 62,000 nyang? The whole foundation would have been uprooted.”


“What if it was just some kind of game?”


“If you enjoy this kind of entertainment, you will die at the hands of the Heavenly Demon Leader. Let’s say it was entertainment. If it was, who would be alive here?”


“Honestly, I also found it strange. That’s why I thought that the evil Soma had gone mad.”


If you keep staring at a white wall like that, you’ll go crazy someday.


“I’m still fine. I met you a while ago.”


Chuseng was startled when he heard that I had met the evil Soma. However, he didn’t seem to think that I was bragging because of the skills I had shown.


“Are you saying that the evil Soma is really in your school?”


For a moment, I hesitated to answer. When I left, the evil Soma was not in the evil song.


“There was.”


It’s not that I don’t want to argue with Chusaeng. It’s because I’m sure that it’s not the work of the evil soma. My father says that you can never know what’s in a person’s mind, but there are things that you can know. No matter how evil the evil soma is, he’s not the kind of person who would do something like this.


“If he is fake, then the people in your church are also fake.”


I wondered how intense it must have been for him to say something like that.


I walked slowly and looked around the main hall. I recalled the situation at that time. The sight of the people of Wolpungmun being killed and their money stolen.


Why on earth would they do something like this? For money? Or to get us involved? We need to find some clues about them in this incomprehensible case.


“Okay. Let’s say it’s fake, like you said. Why on earth did that fake guy do something like this? Is he trying to cause discord with the Murim Alliance? Is he trying to start a war?”


“If that was the case, I would have touched the Jeongpa sect belonging to the Murim Alliance.”


“Then what the hell is going on?”




“That’s why I came. To find out what’s going on.”


Chuseng, who had been staring at me for a moment, opened the door and went out. Outside, Seokhyung, who had gone ahead, and dozens of Wolpungmun warriors were setting up camp.


Chusaeng went out alone and spoke to Seokhyung.


“Put away all the luggage and clean the guest room. I will be treating you as a VIP for the time being.”


“all right.”


Seok-hyung looked relieved. He had called the men together, but it seemed they had decided that they couldn’t handle me.


Chusaeng came back inside.


“I can’t help but think that you might be in league with that guy. But I’m still going to trust you. Do you know why? Because I have to grab onto straws right now.”


Then suddenly he looked up at the ceiling and shouted.


“Father! Grandfather! Please help me! Don’t let me be harassed any longer! Look down on the text! Save my men!”


Since it is fate that we meet, his ancestors are already helping him enough.


He let out a loud scream and revealed his true feelings. He lowered his voice so that his subordinates outside wouldn’t hear.


“I’m ruined because of you. If he’s a fake evil soma like you said, I can’t stop seeking revenge. If he was a real demonic cult, I could at least give up and say there’s nothing I can do. Because of you, I’ve stepped onto a bridge I can never return from. I have to cross this endless bridge of revenge for the rest of my life!”


“I will let you cross that bridge.”


In the past, I arrived late and was in a hurry so I left without being able to investigate properly.


During those days, I didn’t see my father, and I didn’t see Ian. It was a time when I only looked at myself and not at others, so of course I didn’t see Chusaeng either.


“There are many schools in the martial arts world, so there must be a reason why I chose your school. Why you? You are young, bright, hot-tempered, and proud. Aside from what is written on this piece of paper, what else do you have?”


I walked up to him and looked straight into his face and said.


“There must be a reason they chose you. Give me an answer now!”
