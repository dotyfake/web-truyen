# Absolute Regression Chapter 503 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Trong chương này, Jin Ha-gun cùng đội diệt ma tiến đến sơn trang (mountain lodge) để giải cứu gia quyến của một vị tướng quân nổi tiếng, theo lời đồn đang ẩn náu tại đây. Geommugeuk (Kiếm Vũ Cực) cảnh báo về một cái bẫy có thể xảy ra, dựa trên những lời tiên đoán trước đây của Hí Viện Kiếm Vũ (Sword Dance Theater).

Jin Ha-gun quyết định đối mặt trực diện để giải cứu người bị nạn kịp thời. Cậu nhờ Geommugeuk chăm sóc em trai mình nếu cậu không may qua đời, nhưng Geommugeuk từ chối, khẳng định rằng Jin Ha-gun sẽ không chết.

Khi đến sơn trang, họ gặp được sự đón tiếp có phần bất ngờ từ một người quản lý trung niên. Jin Ha-gun và Geommugeuk dẫn đầu đội diệt ma tiến vào. Geommugeuk nhận thấy sự phòng thủ quá mức cần thiết tại nơi này. Chủ sơn trang, Yu Beom, đón tiếp họ một cách lịch sự. Jin Ha-gun chất vấn về việc một chiếc xe không người lái (unmanned vehicle) từ vụ án ở chợ Yuming (Yuming Market) đã được phát hiện tại đây. Yu Beom tỏ ra ngạc nhiên và phủ nhận.

Jin Ha-gun yêu cầu được kiểm tra xung quanh, và Yu Beom dẫn họ đi. Geommugeuk gợi ý kiểm tra phòng y tế. Tại đây, họ phát hiện ra một lượng lớn thảo dược đã qua sử dụng, và Jin Ha-gun biết được Yu Beom đã mua một lượng lớn dược liệu gần đây. Yu Beom giải thích rằng đó là để chữa trị cho những người bị thương trong quá trình luyện tập, nhưng lại nói rằng đã cho họ về quê nghỉ ngơi.

Cuối cùng, Yu Beom dẫn Jin Ha-gun và đội diệt ma đến một lối đi bí mật dẫn xuống một căn phòng dưới lòng đất, nơi có nhiều người đang nằm trên giường. Yu Beom tiết lộ rằng đây là những người sống sót từ gia đình vị tướng quân, và bản thân vị tướng quân đã qua đời vì vết thương quá nặng. Ông ta nói rằng trước khi chết, vị tướng quân đã yêu cầu họ giữ bí mật để bảo vệ gia đình khỏi những kẻ truy sát. Yu Beom cũng tiết lộ rằng vị tướng quân nói kẻ tấn công là một thanh niên sử dụng đại kiếm (great sword), ám chỉ Seodaeryong (Tây Đại Long).

Jin Ha-gun ra lệnh đưa những người này lên mặt đất. Tuy nhiên, Geommugeuk nhận xét rằng số lượng người bị thương tương đương với số lượng ma binh (demon soldiers), và tiết lộ rằng đây thực chất là một cái bẫy. Geommugeuk giải thích rằng mùi hương trong phòng là sự kết hợp của hai loại thảo dược vô hại riêng lẻ, nhưng khi kết hợp lại sẽ tạo ra một loại độc dược tạm thời vô hiệu hóa đối phương. Geommugeuk chỉ ra sự bất thường khi những người này thoát khỏi sự truy lùng của Liên Minh Võ Lâm (Murim Alliance) một cách dễ dàng.

Trong lúc mọi người còn đang bàng hoàng, những người nằm trên giường đồng loạt đứng dậy, lộ rõ thân phận là những chiến binh tinh nhuệ. Yu Beom cũng thay đổi thái độ, để lộ sự thật rằng ông ta đang tham gia vào âm mưu này. Một cánh cửa bí mật mở ra, và Seodaeryong xuất hiện với Đại Kiếm Hủy Diệt (Great Sword of Destruction) trên lưng.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-502/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-504/)503  

What if the predictions of the Sword Dance Theater are correct?




It means that he will die today. Together with the elite extermination force of the Murim Alliance.


If the person who said this wasn’t Geommugeuk, would you have believed it? The fact that there were people who had set a trap to kill him and the Demon King in one place.


‘You would never have believed it, would you?’


But now I believe.


Has he ever been wrong in all his encounters with the Sword Dance Theater? No, not at all. His words have always come true.


His prediction that they might attack the Zhongjingjidan was also correct. If the Demon Army had not come to help, the previous report would have been much more dire.


That’s why Jin Ha-gun’s expression naturally hardened.


‘They are worse than the ones I encountered last time.’


Jin Ha-gun looked at the sword dance.


“That’s fortunate. They probably didn’t take into account a variable like you.”




But Geommugeuk did not let his guard down.


“I don’t know.”


Bloodthirsty Demon was involved, and Seodaeryong was also dragged in. How could he be sure that he was an exception?


“What are you going to do now?”


In response to that question, Geommugeuk left the decision up to Jin Hagun.


“You decide. The famous person’s business is yours.”


It was my hope that Jin Ha-gun would take the lead in this work.


Jin Ha-gun’s gaze turned to Jang Won.


If there is danger lurking there, you can first retreat and then mobilize all of your Zidane drones to come back.


But then the sacrifice of ordinary unmanned personnel could be great. They are the ones waiting to kill the Demon Squad, so the sacrifice of ordinary unmanned personnel would be really great.




Alternatively, you can ask the experts in the field.


But that will take time. Can we really put this off like that?


I didn’t like either method.


So the conclusion is.


“I want to tackle it head on now.”


I wanted to rescue the famous general and his family in time.


If you didn’t know, you wouldn’t know, but if you knew they were here, you had to save them.


That was the reason for the existence of the Murim Alliance’s Demon Extermination Squad.


Geommugeuk, who guessed his mind, smiled and said.


“I’ll watch your back, so you go ahead.”




Jin Ha-gun nodded at the words that were more reassuring than anything else in the world.


Jin Ha-gun gathered all the warriors of the Demon Slayer Corps.


“There is a very high possibility that there are people targeting us at that mountain lodge. So be alert!”


If you don’t know, you might get hurt, but if you prepare in advance, you will never get hurt easily.


Even if there is an absolute master who can overwhelm them.


Jin Ha-gun’s gaze turned towards Geommu-geuk.


‘We also have absolute experts.’


In this way, the Geommu-geuk and Jin Ha-gun took the lead, followed by the Myeolma-dae warriors.


In this situation, Jin Ha-gun felt unfamiliar and new to himself as he walked towards a place that could be a trap with the leader of the Demonic Cult.


The distress I had experienced because I didn’t fully trust the Sword Dance Theater has now completely disappeared. I decided to think that even the faith of the Nine is an overflowing faith.


That must be why I can say things like this so easily.


“Please do me a favor.”


The request was truly unexpected.


“If by any chance I die, please take good care of my little brother.”


Jin Ha-gun didn’t know that he would be asking Geommu-geuk for such a favor. However, he wanted to tell him when he had the chance. Whether it was a friend’s younger sibling, a warrior against a warrior, or a man and a woman. The only person he could trust and entrust his younger sibling to was Geommu-geuk.


After a moment, Geommugeuk answered.


“I can’t grant that request.”


“Why?”


“If you die here and I survive, it will be me who killed you. Even if you don’t think I killed you, your brother or the leader will never forgive me for not being able to save you. That’s why you absolutely cannot die.”


Jin Ha-gun nodded. When he thought about it, it was true. His death would be the signal to start the Great Battle of Jeongma.




So the two of them arrived in front of the garden.


“Is this how you enter through the main gate?”


“Rather, I guess you didn’t expect me to knock on the door like this? You’re catching me off guard.”


After finishing speaking, Geommugeuk banged on the door.


The person who opened the door was a middle-aged man. He seemed to belong to the mountain lodge, and behind him stood three or four other men in the same attire.


The middle-aged warrior was startled when he saw the slaughtering party lined up behind Jin Ha-gun. It felt like dozens of sharp swords were pointed at him.


One of the Demon Slayer Corps’ unmanned units stepped forward.


“I came to see the master. Are you there now?”


The middle-aged man asked in a trembling voice.


“Where are you from?”


“Tell them that the Demon Extermination Lord of the Murim Alliance has arrived.”


The middle-aged warrior was startled by those words. His gaze turned to Jin Ha-gun.


“Are you the real Demon Slayer Lord?”


Jin Ha-gun asked him back.


“If you impersonate the Demon Slayer Lord, you will be locked up in a brain prison for a very long time. Do I look like such a fool to you?”

Even if Jin Ha-gun did not reveal his prayer, the prayers of the demon slayers lined up behind him were enough to prove their identity.


“no.”


When the middle-aged warrior ordered the warrior standing behind him to inform the Demon Destruction Lord that he had arrived, he ran inside.


It seems clear that this visit was completely unexpected.


Jin Ha-gun sent a telegram to their reaction.


-It doesn’t look like a trap?


They were clearly shocked and bewildered by the sudden visit of the Demon King.


-The better the trap, the more likely it is, right?


The Black Magic Circle was still suspicious of this place.


– This person’s martial arts are not ordinary. He probably holds a fairly high position in this mountain lodge. But he personally greeted us. Isn’t that strange?


Jin Ha-gun was able to understand what the message sent by Geommu-geuk meant.


-Does that mean you were preparing for an outside invasion?


-yes.


After a while, the drone that had jumped in came running.


“He told me to hurry and come.”


The middle-aged warrior spoke politely to Jin Ha-gun.


“Go.”


Jin Ha-gun followed him, and the warriors of the Destruction Corps followed him, standing guard in all directions.


As I was entering the hospital, I saw unmanned vehicles everywhere.


Jin Ha-gun asked as if he was looking at a middle-aged warrior.




“It’s too heavily fortified for an ordinary fort.”


Then the middle-aged warrior answered calmly.


“There have been some scary incidents in Chongqing recently, so we have heightened our security.”


In this way, Geommugeuk and Jin Ha-gun arrived at Daecheong.


There, Yu Beom, the head of the Hyangsu Mountain Lodge, welcomed Jin Ha-gun.


“Welcome. What brings you here, my lord?”


Geommu-geuk stood a few steps behind Jin Ha-gun, between the demon corps, and watched the mountain lord’s reaction. Although Yoo Beom was old enough to have experienced all sorts of things, he reacted as if he had never expected this visit.


“I came to see you because I have something to tell you, Master.”


“Please speak.”


Yoo Beom was polite. His opponent was a strong candidate for the next leader, the leader of the elite Demon Extermination Squad of the Murim Alliance.


“Your Majesty, do you know about the incident that happened at Yuming Market?”


“Of course.”


“The unmanned vehicle that was in the famous store was spotted at this mountain lodge.”


“At the main office? How could that be? It must be someone who looks like him.”


Just the surprised reaction and expression made it feel like something I really didn’t know about.


Whether it was a blunt objection or something I really didn’t know, now wasn’t the time to resolve it with words.


“Can I take a look around the garden?”


He looked reluctant, but couldn’t bring himself to refuse.


“Of course. I will guide you.”


Yoo Beom took the lead and guided the two people.




He guided us around the mountain lodge. Aside from the tight security, there was nothing unusual to be found. There were no signs of unmanned vehicles or traps hiding for a surprise attack.


Geommugeuk sent a message to Jin Hagun.


-Ask to see a doctor.


Jin Ha-gun could understand the intention of the sword dance.


“Is there a doctor at the mountain lodge?”


In that moment, Geommugeuk saw a look of slight bewilderment cross Yoobeom’s face.


“It is on a small scale.”


“I want to see that place too.”


So he guided them to the infirmary.


There were a few beds, but no one was in them.


“Is there a member of the mountain lodge?”


“Yes, there is one person.”


“Where are you now?”


“It looks like he’s gone out.”


At that time, the Demon Slayer Corps discovered something.


“Take a look at this.”


There was a pile of grass behind the medical building, which was the leftover scraps from herbs that had been cut out. There was a considerable amount of it, as if they had not been able to throw it away.


Jin Ha-gun said to Yoo Beom.


“I know that you have recently purchased a large quantity of herbs from a nearby clinic. Most of them are for external and internal injuries. Who are you going to treat?”


This time, Yoo Beom was caught right away.




“My subordinates got hurt while practicing.”


“Where are the injured men?”


“I sent him back to his hometown to rest for a while.”


Yu-beom flinched as Jin-ha-gun’s expression grew cold and he revealed a sharp prayer.


The middle-aged warrior who had been in charge of guiding them earlier stepped forward to protect the leader, but the warriors of the Demon Destruction Squad also simultaneously revealed their prayers.


The middle-aged warrior stepped back, overwhelmed by the momentum.


“Your Majesty, Jangju.”


“Speak.”


“I am the one who is trying to save the famous general and his family. Why are you hiding this from me?”


Yoo Beom held on until the end.


“I don’t know what you are talking about.”


“If I give the order, my men will search this mountain lodge thoroughly. If the matter is serious and the master is hiding something, he will pay the price.”


When Jin Ha sensed Yoo Beom’s agitation, he gently persuaded him.


“We are the Demon Squad. I don’t know what you are worried about, but trust us.”


Finally, Yoo Beom sighed and said.


“Follow me.”


Yoo Beom left his men there and headed to the rear with only Jin Ha-gun and the Myeolma-dae.


There was a secret passage leading underground.


“There is a secret hideout in this mountain lodge that has been around for a long time.”


As we went down the stairs, we came across an underground passage, and at the end of that passage was a large room.




As I opened the door and went in, an unknown medicinal scent wafted out.


There were dozens of beds there, all occupied by people.


Yoo Beom said with a sigh.


“These are the survivors of the famous battle. The famous battle master brought the survivors to our mountain lodge.”


Jin Ha-gun was glad that they survived.


“Where is the famous master?”


Then, Yoo Beom let out a sigh of regret and delivered the sad news.


“The famous general died the day after he hid here. His wounds were so deep that there was nothing he could do.”


Jin Ha-gun also sighed.


“Why didn’t you tell us sooner?”


“Before he died, the famous general earnestly asked us not to tell anyone until his family members had healed their wounds.”


“Did you even tell me why?”


Then Yoo Beom nodded.


“They said that if they found out that they were alive, they would come to kill them again. And then soon after, we heard that the Daejeongmun clan had been destroyed. So we knew that this wasn’t just Yumingjang’s problem.”


Jin Ha-gun could roughly guess what was going on. That’s why he must have been scared. He was afraid that he would be involved in this incident and his clan would be destroyed. He didn’t intend to blame him. But he was still treating people like this.


“Did you tell me who did it?”


Yoo Beom hesitated for a moment before answering softly.


“He said he was a young man who used a large sword.”


Looking at it this way, the beast was definitely Seodae-ryong.


“I’m sorry I couldn’t tell you from the beginning.”


“No, I understand how you feel, Yu Jang-ju. For now, we will take these people.”


“Okay, but please keep the fact that I was hiding here a secret.”


“I guess so.”


Rather, he had a relieved expression.


Jin Ha-gun spoke to the warriors of the Destruction Corps.


“Be careful of the famous people and move them to the ground.”


Since the warriors of the Destruction Corps are all highly skilled in martial arts, they will be able to safely transport the patients without any side effects. They were more suitable for this task than ordinary warriors.


Just as the Demon King’s warriors were about to step forward, Geommugeuk, who had been listening, suddenly spoke.


“Coincidentally, the number of injured people is similar to the number of demon soldiers.”


At that moment, everyone’s eyes turned to the sword dance.


“I see now.”


“What did you know?”


Yoo Beom looked at Geommu Geuk with a surprised expression. He thought he was a subordinate, but the two were talking like friends.


Shocking words came out of the sword dance.


“Now I know how I tried to kill you and the Demon Squad.”


Jin Ha-gun was speechless at the sudden words. The warriors of the Demon Slayer Corps also looked at Geommu-geuk with surprised expressions.


“You and the Demon Squad would have all died before you left here.”


“!”


Jin Ha-gun looked at Geommu-geuk without saying a word. Geommu-geuk liked to play all kinds of pranks, but he had never played with a person’s life. He was not the kind of person who would do that.


“What does it mean?”


The gaze of the swordsman turned towards the patients in bed.


“You must have been ambushed while carrying them out.”


That means they are all enemies!


Everyone was shocked. Not only Jin Ha-gun, but no one in the Demon Squad here thought that those patients were enemies.


“Of course no one would suspect anything. These people are not people you just happen to meet on the street.”


Because the famous store and Daejeongmun incident broke out, and they were the ones who were searched for, found evidence, and finally found. Because it was the moment to finally save them.


“They are not famous people. They would have all died that day. They were declared missing for this very moment.”


Jin Ha-gun’s heart grew cold. If that was true, it was a carefully planned conspiracy to kill him and the Demon Squad.


Yoo Beom said with a dumbfounded expression.


“What kind of nonsense are you talking about?”


Geommugeuk spoke to Jin Hagun, ignoring his reaction.


“The medicinal scent that came out when I entered this place was the scent of burning seoryeongcho (Western Spirit Grass).”


The swordsman walked towards the bed.


“This side smells like the non-life herb. Each scent is harmless to humans, but when the two scents come together, it has an effect similar to taking a poisonous poison. It’s only for a short time, but it’s enough time to subdue your opponent.”


When it came to poisonous plants and medicinal herbs, Geommugeuk had a depth of knowledge and learning that was second to none.


Geommugeuk said to Jin Hagun.


“While everyone was injured like this, the person caught in the Murim Alliance surveillance net was fine? Isn’t that strange? He left traces of using herbs behind the medical room?”


Jin Ha-gun nodded.


“It was to drag us here.”


The demon troopers all drew their swords at once.


Then, those who were lying on the bed slowly got up. I could tell just by looking at their eyes. They too were truly well-trained elite warriors.


The look in Yoo-beom’s eyes and voice, which had been flustered and frightened the whole time, changed, and his prayers also changed like those of another person.


“But nothing changes.”


He looked back.


Knock knock.


Then, a hidden door at the back opened and a person walked out.


He was the Bloody Heavenly Sword Horse carrying the Great Sword of Destruction on his back.
