# Absolute Regression Chapter 164 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Jin Ha-ryeong cùng ông nội, Jin Pae-cheon, đi dạo trong đêm. Cô bày tỏ lo ngại về việc bị ép kết hôn chính trị với Triệu vương gia (Prince Zhao), nhưng ông nội trấn an cô rằng ông không có ý định đó. Jin Pae-cheon hỏi về giải đấu Tiểu Long Biên Niên Sử (Little Dragon Chronicles), và cô khẳng định sẽ cố gắng hết sức để giành chiến thắng. Ông nội nhận ra cô đang nghĩ về ai đó và hy vọng đó chỉ là cảm xúc nhất thời.

Trong khi đó, Seo Dae-ryong khoe khoang về việc được nhiều người nhận ra sau khi trở về từ buổi huấn luyện. Anh và nhân vật chính (tôi) thảo luận về việc anh có nên cẩn trọng hơn để tránh nguy hiểm hay không. Sau đó, Triệu Thần (Jo-shin) đến gặp nhân vật chính và trách mắng anh vì đã để Jin Ha-ryeong "phải lòng" anh. Triệu Thần rút dao đe dọa, nhưng nhân vật chính đề nghị sẽ giúp Triệu Thần chiếm được trái tim của Jin Ha-ryeong, với động cơ thực sự là để lợi dụng Triệu Thần, tìm hiểu về Thiên Mệnh Hội (Cheonmyeonghoe), và sau đó thủ tiêu hắn. Anh tiết lộ rằng Jin Ha-ryeong đang tập trung vào giải đấu Tiểu Long (Little Dragon Tournament) và khuyên Triệu Thần nên chúc mừng cô thay vì ép cô kết hôn. Anh còn đòi Triệu Thần chuẩn bị 100,000 lạng.

Hai ngày sau, Seo Dae-ryong thắng giải đấu Palgang Bimu, nhưng bị thương nặng ở vai. Trên đường đến lều của nghị viên, Seo Dae-ryong nhắn tin cho nhân vật chính, trêu chọc về việc ai sẽ thay thế vị trí của anh nếu anh chết. Nhân vật chính chữa trị cho Seo Dae-ryong bằng chân khí (true energy). Seo Dae-ryong muốn tiếp tục tham gia giải đấu Sagang Bimu dù bị thương, nhưng nhân vật chính biết rằng anh muốn tham gia là vì bài kiểm tra người kế vị. Anh đồng ý giúp Seo Dae-ryong, nhưng cảnh báo anh về con đường đầy máu và đau khổ phía trước.

Nhân vật chính đưa Seo Dae-ryong đến Trung Nguyên Chiến Trường (Jungwon Battlefield) và tìm thấy 500,000 lạng. Anh tiết lộ rằng họ sẽ không luyện tập khổ sở mà sẽ đến "thiên đường" nơi có chi phí rất đắt đỏ.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-163/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-165/)Episode 164 Once you enter that road.




That night, an unexpected person visited Jin Ha-ryeong’s sleepless residence. It was his grandfather, Jin Pae-cheon.


“Aren’t you asleep yet?”


“yes.”


“Should we go for a walk with Grandpa for the first time in a while?”


“great.”


She walked through the inner courtyard with Jinpaecheon. The guards here and there left their places and disappeared.


“Are you feeling sad because of me these days? I’m sorry, Grandpa.”


Jinpaecheon didn’t mention it, but he didn’t look angry either.


“You attended the banquet today?”


“Yes. It was a banquet hosted by Prince Jinryongjang Jo.”




“How was it?”


It was a grandfather who had never asked such a question before. If he knew that he was present, he would also know that Geomyeon was there.


“Grandpa, have you ever seen someone and imagined something? An animal, or something else?”


“Yes. There was one recently too.”


The person that Jinpaecheon thought of was Geommu-geuk. He still can’t forget the image that came to mind in the midst of the surprise and shock when he was stopped by his momentum.


“This is my first time experiencing it. When I saw someone, a snake came to mind.”


Even if I don’t say ‘be careful’, Grandpa will know who I’m talking about.


Indeed, Jinpaecheon did not ask who it was.


I thought he would be cautious, but my grandfather didn’t show much of a reaction.


Now that they had a private moment, she revealed her honest feelings about caution.




“Even if I were to enter into a political marriage, it would not be to Prince Zhao.”


Then Jin Pae-cheon said something unexpected.


“I have no intention of forcing you into a political marriage with Prince Zhao.”


“really?”


“I already have everything. Why should I regret anything?”


Jin Ha-ryeong smiled brightly at Jin Pae-cheon’s firm words. He really was a wonderful grandfather.


“I knew it.”


Jin Ha-ryeong linked arms with his grandfather.


“What is a big guy doing?”


“Just walk like this for a little bit.”




Jinpaecheon looked at his granddaughter with a loving smile. She was the only one who brought joy to the hard life of the leader. It seems like only yesterday that she was walking, but she has already grown so much.


“Were you upset with this old man?”


“No, Grandpa, I understand. What kind of grandfather would like his granddaughter to hang out with a servant?”


“It’s not because that kid is a servant.”


“sure?”


Jinpaecheon didn’t explain the reason. He thought there was no need to talk about Geommu-geuk’s true identity.


Jinpaecheon changed the subject.


“How about the Little Dragon Chronicles?”


“I’m doing my best.”


“Are you confident that you can win?”


“As you know, I worked really hard for this competition. I will definitely win!”


Knowing this well, Jin Pae-cheon hesitated. To be honest, he felt like recommending abstention. Even though he knew that Cheon Myeong-hoe was involved, he hoped that Jin Ha-ryeong would not be involved in the first place.


But I couldn’t tell my granddaughter to give up because I knew how hard she had worked for this competition.


“Do your best.”


“Yes, Grandpa.”


The two walked for a long time under the moonlight. Jinpaecheon noticed that his granddaughter was thinking of someone at every moment of their walk.


I had a guess as to who it was… …so I just hoped it was just a passing fever from my youth.


\* \* \*


Seo Dae-ryong, who returned from training, was very excited.


“Do you know how many people recognized me on my way back?”




“How many women, exactly, pretended to know him?”


“You’re so quick-witted. How many people are there?”


“That depends on how slow you walk.”


On a crowded street, especially when there seemed to be a lot of women, Seo Dae-ryong would show off his turtle skills. Then, if someone noticed him, he would run towards him like an excited rabbit.


“Five people?”


For a moment, Seo Dae-ryong flinched.


“How did you know?”


“I analyzed it based on my current state of excitement.”


“Is that possible? Were you perhaps protecting me? Afraid I might be in danger?”


“Ah! Now that I think about it, that could be possible. I never once thought that our master could be in danger.”


“… … Because I am trustworthy, right?”


“……of course.”


“No! You forgot! Why would you leave me alone if I was in danger?”


“You get into danger, you get taken hostage, you get hurt, and you become a real unmanned person. Why do you do this? You know it all.”


“I will decline! I will live quietly, without getting hurt, without being involved in conspiracies, and just diligently training in martial arts as an investigator of the Hwangcheon Pavilion. I train in martial arts for health reasons!”

“Are you upset? Because I didn’t care?”


“no.”


“Wouldn’t it be better for you to not care?”


“What are you talking about?”


“Even if someone finds out about us, they think I’m worth using if I don’t care at all. They probably think that provoking them will only reveal their true identities.”


“Ah! You thought about that.”


“Of course. I like being like other people.”


At that moment, Seo Dae-ryong looked far away outside the inn and said.


“Here comes our patron saint.”


The man walking toward him was Jo-shin. He must have teased Seo Dae-ryong a lot for shaving his beard and buying him new clothes.


“Okay, then let’s disperse like everyone else.”


Seo Dae-ryong quickly went up to this floor.


After a while, Jo Shin came into the guest room and sat down in front of me.


“The noodles here are delicious. Would you like some?”


At my words, Jo-shin snorted with an expression that said, “Are you eating noodles right now?”


I had that thought when I saw Jo Shin. Even a villain needs to go through a process. The difference between Jo Shin, who was the head of the Shinryong family, and Jo Shin now is as big as whether I shave my beard or not.


“Should you have won that fight yesterday? Or should you have been beaten?”


“I didn’t realize it. I’m sorry.”


“It’s not something that can be resolved by saying sorry. Because Miss Jin has fallen for you even more.”


Jo Shin took out a dagger.




“Now I have no choice but to turn that pretty face of yours into a Go board.”


If he were a middle-aged man, instead of drawing his dagger, he would have taken me to the best restaurant in the area and treated me with a bright smile. He would have fed me more delicious food and praised me more for the one he hated. He would have been quiet and persistent, never revealing his feelings until he got what he wanted. If he had, it would have been difficult to deal with him like a demon, but now, Jo-sin was in the palm of my hand.


“Rather, if you use me, you will be able to win Lady Jin’s heart. I know women’s hearts well. If I help you, you will be able to marry Lady Jin.”


Jo Shin knew that Jin Ha Ryeong was definitely going to marry her. So it would be difficult for her to refuse this proposal.


“What do you know about something like that?”


“If I didn’t know anything, how could I have let Miss Jin fall for me?”


“Was it all intentional?”


“Of course. Every word and every action must be planned out. Problems between men and women cannot be resolved by rushing.”


There was a ronin who was a womanizer during his time as a ronin. He would tell everyone about his experiences during breaks, and if you just tell the stories you heard there, you can make Jo Shin feel good.


“What is your intention in helping me?”


“What do I have to say? It’s all about money.”


“Now that I look at it, this guy is something.”


This guard must not be installed until the winner emerges. When Cheonmyeonghoe approaches the winner in earnest, we will be able to tell by looking at the guard’s actions. Whether he is related to Cheonmyeonghoe or not.


Until then, I have to become the kind of person who uses money to get women. That’s why I have to let Jo-shin tell me his secrets. Not because he trusts me, but because he’s someone I’ll kill when I’m done.


“Do you know why Lady Jin is avoiding Prince Zhao now?”


“what?”


“Miss Jin is a person who seeks freedom. However, if you try to force her into a political marriage, it is only natural that she will resist. The reason she rejected Prince Zhao and felt affection for me is because of that resistance.”


Cho Shin’s expression slightly relaxed. It meant that the reason she didn’t like him wasn’t because of him.


“Did she say that?”


“Do I really have to tell you? You can tell just by looking at the expression.”




“so?”


“Right now, she is concentrating on the Little Dragon Tournament. If you push her to get married at this time, will it work? At times like this, you should cheer her on so she can win the Little Dragon Tournament.”


Jo-shin nodded as if he hadn’t thought about that. People like Jo-shin are like that. They only think about themselves rather than others, so they have no understanding or consideration for others.


“Please go and congratulate Lady Jin on her wedding day.”


“Congratulations? Then should I buy you flowers or a gift?”


“If it was when you won, it would be different, but if you won in the Palgang River and received a gift, it would be burdensome. Please go and congratulate me with words.”


“Then I guess I should prepare a gift in case I win.”


“As expected, you are smart! From martial arts to family and even your looks. Prince Jo is perfect in every way. If you choose the right method, there is no reason for Lady Jin to refuse.”


Cho-shin, who was happy about my compliments, smiled at me. However, there was still a murderous intent in his eyes that could not be hidden. He must be thinking about the moment when he used me to his heart’s content and then killed me.


“You clever little brat! If she sees your true self, she’ll run away in terror.”


I told him to get up from his seat.


“Make sure to prepare one hundred thousand nyang!”


When I disappear like smoke from the Murim Alliance, this little villain who will become the future leader of the world will also disappear from this world.


The moment Jin Ha-ryeong reached out to her servant and asked her to be his friend, she wasn’t holding my hand, she was holding my new life.


\* \* \*


Seo Dae-ryong won the Palgang Bimu held two days later.


But in the process, he suffered a major wound to his shoulder when his opponent’s sword stabbed him.


The dispatchers ran up to him, carried him on their backs, and ran to the tent where the congressman was waiting.


I ran after them too.


Seo Dae-ryong sent me a message while he was on his back.




– When I die, please tell our drinking comrades! This Seodaeryong fought bravely and died without regrets!


-If you have anything to say, please say it quickly. Should I give the right arm position to Jang-ho?


-No!


-Then who should I give it to? Ian?


-No!


-Then who?


-Even if I become a ghost, I won’t give up that seat.


The member’s treatment is finished.


Fortunately, his life was not in danger, but the wound was quite deep.


The Murim Alliance doctor prescribed a topical ointment and some medicine to eat, and advised me to rest for a while.


He returned to the guest room and sat Seo Dae-ryong down.


“Sit down.”


“yes.”


I injected a single ray of energy into Seodaeryong’s back. My true energy slowly flowed through his blood vessels and soothed his injured area. Depending on whether or not I did this process, the speed of recovery from injuries greatly differed.


“Thank you, I feel much better.”


“Don’t worry. I checked and fortunately, no major blood vessels were damaged, and no bones were damaged.”


Originally, Seo Dae-ryong’s skill was limited to eight strong points. However, he barely won this time because he poured all his luck, talent, and effort into it.


But Seo Dae-ryong seems to want to go all the way.


“Can I go to Sagang Bimu with this body?”


I knew full well that he wanted to go out, so I deliberately did not try to stop him.




“I have to go out. I have to go out and win, wrapped up in bandages. I have to go out even if I lose the use of one arm. This is such an important task.”


Then, Seo Dae-ryong’s reaction was unexpected.


“yes.”


I was rather startled by his polite answer.


“What? I have to tell him that he can’t go out. Why is this little bastard selling his arms? I have to ask him about it!”


“There’s too much at stake for that to be the case.”


“What’s going on? What’s so important about the Murim Alliance’s martial arts tournament?”


“No, it’s the test for your successor. I have to win to chase after those guys.”


I stared at Seo Dae-ryong’s face. Seo Dae-ryong’s eyes, which were filled with loyalty and passion, finally avoided my eyes. The arrest is complete.


“You want to get away with this kind of emotion?”


“Did you get a ticket?”


“Of course. It was a passion that was so unlike you. You’re the kind of person who wouldn’t give up your arms even if the sky fell.”


“Of course. Even if the martial arts world falls, I won’t give up my arm. Well done, Seo Dae-ryong! You’re amazing, Seo Dae-ryong! Just advancing to the Four Rivers is enough! Praise!”


I laughed at his teasing, and Seo Dae-ryong followed suit and screamed in pain.


“Ahh! It hurts. Don’t make me laugh.”


“You’re making everyone laugh. Take a break.”


As I was leaving the room, Seo Dae-ryong asked me from behind.


“Isn’t that really not possible?”


Unlike before, his tone was serious. I could feel his desire to continue competing.


“no.”


“The successor exam is a test, but it’s also because of me. I felt a lot while doing this non-competition. I also want to see it through to the end.”


There was silence for a moment.


“Inspector Seo, once you start down that path, it’s hard to get off.”


“What kind of road is that?”


“It’s the path you take when you go up to the stage with your injured arm tied up. It’s the path you walk with blood flowing from your whole body, limping, and not being able to see with one eye.”


This was me searching for the last of the Dafa materials.


I wanted to stop him because I lived that kind of life, and I couldn’t stop him because I knew better than anyone how much that life makes a person grow.


But once you cross the line and taste that world, you won’t be able to live as an investigator of the Hwangcheon Pavilion who trains in martial arts for health.


“At least this time, I want to go.”


“The next opponent will be hard to beat even if he isn’t injured.”


“Please tell me the way.”


“If you overdo it, you might never be able to use your injured arm again.”


“Then I’ll get my right arm too. Oh, I guess it’ll be my left arm.”


“You could get seriously injured.”


“While you’re at it, let’s take a rest.”


The will contained in Seo Dae-ryong’s eyes was no different from my will in the past.


“Then you shouldn’t be sitting there like that.”


Seo Dae-ryong suddenly got up from his seat.


“Your fate always changes in the guest house.”


“The footnote is always there.”


How could it be because of me or the place? It must be because of the unyielding determination of that small, stubborn man.


I took him out of the inn.


Seo Dae-ryong shouted, burning with heat.


“Now, from now on, it’s hell training!”


I said to Seo Dae-ryong, who was walking briskly towards the mountain where we had been training.


“It’s not there, it’s this way.”


I walked in the opposite direction.


“There’s a place we need to stop by first.”


The place I stopped by with him was the Jungwon Battlefield. There, I found five hundred thousand nyang.


“Why are you looking for so much money?”


“We won’t go to hell. If we practice in hell with our injured bodies, our bodies will only get worse.”


“Then where are you going?”


“Heaven.”


I gave a meaningful smile to the surprised Seo Dae-ryong.


“We are going to paradise. To paradise where the entrance fee is very expensive.”
