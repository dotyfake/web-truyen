# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 207 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Jeong Yeon-shin nhận chỉ thị về nhiệm vụ bí mật và liên lạc với Iphwangma để phối hợp các sự kiện gia tộc, tạo không gian yên tĩnh. Cậu lo ngại về mẹ của Masain, Joo Yeon-jeong, một người khó đoán và độc đoán. Việc Mayeonjeok thu nhận Đại Hwandan (Great Hwandan) phải được giữ bí mật tuyệt đối.

Cheongmyeong báo cáo về số lượng người còn lại trong đội: năm người thuộc nhóm "trắng" và mười bảy người thuộc nhóm "lam" không được giao nhiệm vụ. Jeongyeonshin ngồi tại bàn làm việc, cùng Cheongmyeong và Baekmiryeo thảo luận về việc lực lượng tinh nhuệ của Đại Phòng Ngự Phái (Great Defense Sect) bị suy giảm. Baek Mi-ryeo nhận định ngân sách sẽ giảm theo số lượng nhân sự, đồng thời Ma Gwang-ik không còn đủ khả năng đối phó với hai mươi tư người của Hoa Sơn Phái (Hwasan Faction), ảnh hưởng đến uy tín của Jeong Yeon-shin và con đường thăng tiến lên cấp "tím". Jeong Yeon-shin quyết định sẽ bắt đầu từ mười tám người "lam" và bảy người "trắng".

Jeong Yeon-shin thông báo đã nhận được lời hứa chỉ dẫn từ tiền bối Hahu của Cheonrimdaeju (Cheonrimdaeju), theo đó Hyosu Sword Kang Changmu, Dangang Dogak Ho Wooncheol, Simhyeop Gwon Gong Yamiryeong sẽ gia nhập làm lực lượng chính, và giao việc chuẩn bị đón tiếp cho Cheongmyeong và Baek Mi-ryeo. Baek Mi-ryeo vui vẻ trêu chọc việc Jeong Yeon-shin định trao bí kíp cho các cổ đông lớn. Cheongmyeong tiết lộ có kẻ đã cố lừa Jeong Yeon-shin và sẽ đến xin lỗi.

Jeong Yeon-shin hỏi về tiến độ làm tay giả cho Oh Wol-hyang, người đã mất một tay ở Myeonggongdo. Baek Mi-ryeo cho biết nó sẽ hoàn thành trong vòng một tháng. Sau đó, Jeong Yeon-shin đề nghị tập trung vào sáu cao thủ "lam" và tính toán số lượng tiền bối "đen" phải đối phó. Cheongmyeong gợi ý sử dụng võ thuật đảo (island martial arts) để huấn luyện, kể tên ba người "lam" đã học võ của Jeong Yeon-shin trong Huyết Đoàn (Blood Corps) và Seonmokryeong. Anh cũng nhắc đến Shin So-bin, người đã trở nên nổi tiếng ở đó và sử dụng rất tốt Shihwamugeukwon và Hwanikbo.

Cheongmyeong và Baekmirye tiếp tục trò chuyện, Jeong Yeon-shin cảm thấy như đang ở nhà và trò chuyện với anh chị em của mình. Cheongmyeong kể về những lời đồn liên quan đến Huyết Huyết Đại Sư (Blood-Blooded Great Master), và Baekmirye cảnh báo về Jeolhak của Bukhae mà Seonmokryungju đã luyện tập. Jeong Yeon-shin tự tin tuyên bố có cơ hội chiến thắng trước thuyền phu và người băng.

Một ngày sau, ba sự kiện lớn xảy ra: tin tức về việc Ma Gwang-ik-ju vinh quang trở về sau chiến thắng trong cuộc Thập Tự Chinh Khai Mạc của Liên Minh Murim (Murim Alliance’s Opening Crusade) lan truyền rộng rãi; việc các cao thủ Cheonrimdae thay đổi liên kết được công bố, phá vỡ dự đoán về sự suy yếu của Ma Gwang-ik; và việc xuất bản Baekhwajeonram, một lá thư được gửi đến các đại lãnh chúa yêu cầu họ tập trung tại Wonpyeongil Inspection Hall.

Ngoài ra, Jeong Yeon-shin, đại diện cho Ma Kwang-ik, đã gửi một lá thư khiêu khích đến Cheon So-so, Lãnh chúa của Rừng Thiên Đường (Lord of the Heavenly Forest), đề nghị tuân theo ý kiến của người chiến thắng theo các điều kiện đã nêu. Điều này đã gây ra một làn sóng bàn tán xôn xao và thu hút đông đảo người dân đến trường huấn luyện trung tâm của Iphwangseong.

Hai vị lãnh đạo lớn, Ma Gwang Ik Ju và Seonmok Ryeong Ju, đối mặt nhau trên sân khấu. Jeong Yeon-shin mở lời thách đấu. Cậu biết Seonmokryeongju Cheon Soso coi thường người Hán.

Cheon So-so tấn công trước với tốc độ kinh người, bao phủ cơ thể bằng một luồng khí trắng xóa. Jeongyeonshin cảm nhận được đó là một thần kỹ (divine skill). Cậu điều khiển Bánh Xe Ánh Sáng (Wheel of Light) trong tim mình.

Hai người giao chiến ác liệt, nhiệt độ giảm xuống đáng kể. Jeongyeonshin sử dụng Neungbeop Gwangryungi để chống lại sức mạnh băng giá của Cheon So-so. Khoảnh khắc Jeong Yeon-shin nắm lấy tay Cheon So-so, băng vỡ tan.

Jeongyeon Shin sử dụng Mancheonhwawoo, Hwankang. Cheon So-so tỏ vẻ kinh ngạc.

**NOTICE: Many of the novels have been removed because they might cause violations, which we were not aware of earlier.**




[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/surviving-as-a-genius-on-borrowed-time-chapter-206/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/surviving-as-a-genius-on-borrowed-time-chapter-208/)Blue




Jeong Yeon-shin gave instructions regarding the secret mission and sent a message to Iphwangma.


The story was about coordinating all the family events, big and small, to create a quiet place.


I was concerned about Masain’s mother, Joo Yeon-jeong. As a member of the royal family, she was difficult to understand and was an authoritarian figure.


The intake of the Great Hwandan by Mayeonjeok had to be carried out in utmost secrecy. If it were Majin, he would immediately understand the meaning between the lines.


‘As soon as I get a reply, I have to stay by my grandfather’s side.’


Jeongyeonshin thought.


one side.


“There are four white people who were not dispatched for missions, and including Heonwonchang, there are five in total. Likewise, there are two blue people who were not dispatched for missions, and there are seventeen blue people in total.”


Cheongmyeong reported in a clear tone.


The location had changed.




Jeongyeonshin sat in the office chair. A finely crafted marble desk was placed across from her, and Cheongmyeong and Baekmirye were sitting as guests.


The two chairs were smaller than that of the Great Master of Magwangikju.


A peaceful atmosphere flowed even without a cup of tea.


If the matter had not been so serious, I would have taken out Tieguanyin (a type of oolong tea).


“Seventeen blue and five white… It’s an ambiguous force to call them the elite of the Great Defense Sect. It’s both true and false. Originally, there were ten out of twenty-six. Anonymous is not a force.”


Cheongmyeong’s expression was calm. He did not express any particular feelings about the power reduction.


It was a result of the deaths of colleagues who had been treated like death row inmates.


It makes no sense to express regret about the power, and it has already been a long time since I felt sad enough to feel regret again.


Baek Mi-ryeo, who was standing next to him, brushed back the hair behind her ears.


“You see, now that you’ve seen the ledger? It’s only natural that the budget will decrease as the number of personnel decreases. However, the problem is that there are restrictions on receiving missions. Our Ma Gwang-ik can no longer handle the twenty-four plum blossom inspectors of the Hwasan faction. A small difference makes a big difference. The Shingeomdan’s armed forces, who cannot completely stop the elite of the Daebang faction, will inevitably be eliminated in terms of public service.”




She spoke softly.


There was not a single word wrong. He calmly assessed the current situation.


It meant that since his power was very ambiguous, it would be difficult to deploy him in major incidents. His accumulated achievements would inevitably decrease.


While this was a story that was directly connected to Ma Gwang-ik’s prestige, it also meant that Jeong Yeon-shin’s progress to purple was hindered.


That’s why I speak so seriously.


The prayer of Cheongmyeong was cool and transparent, and Baek Miryeo’s face had no expression. This was because she knew Jeongyeonshin’s constitution.


The new leader, Ma Gwang-ik, opened his mouth.


“Blue is eighteen, white is seven. Let’s start from there.”


“Why?”


Baek Mi-ryeo’s eyebrows furrowed. Cheong-myeong, who was next to her, also tilted his head slightly.




Not only blue, but even white has the skills to be considered a rare master in the local powerhouses.


It meant that he was not an ordinary unmanned person. He was only placed at the bottom of the Iphwangseong, a large faction in the upper echelons of the martial arts world, so it would not be easy to obtain him.


The blue master added more. When Jeong Yeon-sin, who borrowed the blue robe of Cheongmyeong, single-handedly destroyed the Tanglang faction in Shaanxi Province.


A sword that can handle a medium-sized sect.


The blue color of the Yellow Emperor is the main power of the nature. No major power is willing to give it up easily.


When Jeong Yeon-shin mentioned the dispatch of Baek Gi-rin and Namgung Hwa-shin, the reaction of Suncheon Ik-ju Ha Do-woon, who showed a very sensitive appearance, was natural.


Now, I feel a bit sorry.


Jeong Yeon-shin continued speaking calmly.


“I received a promise of guidance from the Cheonrimdaeju Hahu Senior. There was some kind of deal. Hyosu Sword Kang Changmu, Dangang Dogak Ho Wooncheol, Simhyeop Gwon Gong Yamiryeong will be coming in as a main force. Please prepare to welcome them. I will be busy with various things, so you two should do it.”


“How many hours have passed since I got back… …!”


Baek Mi-ryeo let out a sigh with a smile on her face.


“You really meant it? You said you were going to hand over the secret recipe to the big shareholders. Honestly, I wanted to tell you not to lose because it would be a total embarrassment, but I didn’t dare to do it.”


Cheongmyeong was smiling brightly. It was a smile he had never seen before when he came to Ma Gwang-ik-ju’s office.


The two of them watched Jeongyeonshin repeatedly break her limits. Neither of them was surprised.


It was just a great sight. As Baek Mi-ryeo’s eyes drew a curve, the atmosphere lightened in an instant.


“There was a guy who tried to trick you earlier. He’ll come and apologize tomorrow.”


“A guy so reckless came out to greet me?”


Even the breeze that enveloped Cheongmyeong’s body changed into a soft, blunt texture.


The unique function was like a breeze, and if Jeongyeonshin wasn’t wearing a black robe, it would have stroked her hair.


The renowned swordsman laughed.




“You just need to be around twenty-four. Even if you’re that old, you’ll be able to easily get the mission to fight the elite of the Daebangpa. I know the Cheonrimdae’s Hyosu Sword. You’re pretty good at using the sword. You’ve been given a really good hand.”


“The Iron Troops brought from Myeonggongdo, how is the progress of the prosthetic limb?”


Jeong Yeon-shin thought of Ma-jin and Oh Wol-hyang. While her uncle had ascended to the position of head of the Iphwangma family, Oh Wol-hyang, the blue-haired master, was still Ma Gwang-ik.


A woman who treated Jeongyeonshin like a son since her initiation. She was a Taoist master known as Ingwanghyeopdo (仁曠俠刀) before losing her left arm in Myeonggongdo.


Baek Mi-ryeo smiled faintly.


“He said that if it’s an aerodynamic prosthesis, it will be completed within a month. Don’t worry about that.”


“That’s fortunate.”


There was a great sense of relief. Jeong Yeon-shin nodded and continued speaking slowly.


“Let’s focus on the six blue masters. I’ll have to figure out how many black seniors I’ll have to deal with.”


“If we’re going to do it, wouldn’t it be better to do it with the island martial arts? Wouldn’t it be easier to train? The stronger the martial arts, the better.”


Cheongmyeong smiled brightly. Then, he started counting his long fingers one by one.


“If you count the number of the military units that the great lords had a break from… … There were three blues who learned your martial arts in the blood corps and the Seonmokryeong. It wasn’t a mess. Those who had useful skills focused on the Shigeukgyeong, and those who learned the Gwanghwageomryu, Shihwamugeukkwon, and Hwanikbo. Sometimes they would hang around and ask for advice. Shin So-bin became popular there.”


“Shin So-bin… …?”


Jeong Yeon-shin asked back.


The face of my cat-like junior came to mind. He had a bubbly personality that could even make a fuss about Tae-yeon-ryong.

She was a girl of the same age as Jeong Yeon-shin, and was the precious daughter of the Shin family under the command of Iphwangseong.


He was noted as a talented person who would take on the role of a white-clad islander with outstanding qualities. He is currently said to be staying in the main hall of his family home for a while.


“I know you have been introduced to my martial arts.”


Jeong Yeon-shin said.


Cheongmyeong nodded.


“Apart from the color of your uniform, you could say that you are the pioneer of your martial arts. You use Shihwamugeukwon and Hwanikbo very well. I worship you. I heard you beat my sister in Suncheonik a while ago? That friend of yours, Shin Binbin. I heard she complained that you brought Baekgirin around like her subordinate.”


“Is that why you applied for the military service?”


“Shin So-bin couldn’t stand it anymore, and was eventually dragged into the family home. I saw her expression when she was unpacking her things… … She seemed very relieved. Anyway, there were a lot of incidents while you were gone.”


“The Shin family has abused their authority. We must bring them in soon.”


“It’s really scary that your tone is so calm?”


Cheongmyeong’s smile deepened.


“Then let’s start with the story of the great masters. The Blood-Blooded Great Master and the Sunmok-Ryeong-Ju… … They are extremely skilled masters who have no answers when you meet them as enemies. They are not only invincible, but the martial arts they have learned are extremely tricky. The Blood-Blooded Great Master is quite a mysterious person, and there are many rumors. For example, he learned the evil arts of Sima Weidao, and that he is the illegitimate child of the Blood Flame Sect leader.”


“I know about Seonmokryungju well. She has trained the Jeolhak of Bukhae. Since she is a master of Binggong (氷功), you should be careful with her internal methods. She is a master at hardening the inside of the enemy’s body. Her hands are as firm as Sima Wei’s, and she does not have private relations with the Han people. You should ask for a secret battle with the mindset of facing a life-or-death decision. To be honest, I am very worried.”


Cheongmyeong and Baekmirye continued their conversation.


‘good night.’


Jeongyeonshin liked this time. It felt like she was finally back home and chatting with her siblings.


It was something I had never experienced before, but it felt that way. My mind was gently melting as I discussed things that I should have been nervous about.


Is it because I have faced hostility from many people at the meeting?


I slowly moved my lips away.


“If it’s the boatman and the iceman, then we have a good chance of winning.”




\* \* \*


A day later.


Three things happened at the same time.


The story of Ma Gwang-ik-ju’s return home in glory after winning the Murim Alliance’s Opening Crusade was known even before his return.


Thanks to that, the whole nature was excited from the beginning. It meant that it was not something that would be newly known.


If there is a new incident here, it means that it is news equivalent to the victory of Magwangikju.


The change in affiliation of the Cheonrimdae masters has been announced.


From Cheonrimdae to Ma Gwang-ik.


With Shin Jin-dae taking over as the new leader of the military, many predicted that Ma Gwang-ik’s weakness would continue.


It was because the brilliant masters laid the foundation for the Shingeomdan.


The changes in the lives of many masters, including Hyosu Sword, broke that prediction. It became a huge topic of conversation.


“How could the Lord of Heaven… …?”


“He’s not a great man who would let go of what he has in his hands. He’s a man with a tremendous sense of pride. I once had a drink with him, and it really took my breath away.”


“Are you saying that you secretly fought with Magwangikju?”


“The God of Heavenly Power was defeated? No way… … .”


“Whether it was Bimu or something, there was definitely some kind of bet. He wouldn’t be the kind of person to give such a great favor to the Han people without asking for anything in return.”


“In one way or another, isn’t it true that Magwangikju has won? He is truly a mysterious person. The achievements he has accumulated for his age are all extraordinary.”


There was a murmur of discontent throughout the vast city.


The world’s rare elite masters shared all sorts of stories, and eavesdropping was done on high-ranking officials and merchants who had access to the city.


The personal details of the new leader, Ma Gwang-ik, have begun to be compiled in the private sector.




The second was the publication of the Baekhwajeonram.


It was not done externally. The Lord of Iphwangseong was not a foolish person.


In order to keep the Emperor in check, hundreds of sects formed an alliance. There was no need to attract the attention of the entire martial arts world.


A letter was delivered to the grand lords. It was an order to gather at the Wonpyeongil Inspection Hall by the next day.


The blacksmiths all received documents with the seal of the lord at once. There was a close relationship between the lords.


Countless speculations followed about something that rarely happened.


Although the Shingeombu Daeju and Cheonrim Daeju showed signs of vague understanding, they did not open their mouths.


Just noticed another incident.


[… … Therefore, I, the great lord, shamelessly request a secret meeting with the Lord of the Heavenly Forest, Cheon So-so (千素蔬), and propose that I follow the winner’s opinion according to the conditions stated above.]


The visit of Jeong Yeon-sin, the Magwangikju, was extended throughout the entire Iphwangseong area.


It was not a personal story. It was a position representing Ma Kwang-ik. It meant that he was not in a position to lower his position by calling himself a senior.


That is why Jeong Yeon-shin’s writing was so interesting and provocative.


The handwriting was neat and tidy, not befitting the content of the wall-crawling bomb. It was a regular script (楷書體) close to the standard of Ming Dynasty calligraphy.


The transfer of the masters under the Shingeomdan is a very sensitive matter. This is because they are the pillars of Iphwangseong.


If you are a major shareholder, you must be aware of the gazes that spread across the vast nature. It is something that even those who are not directly involved must be convinced of.


The seat of the Great King of the Heavenly Realm is the seat that represents the true nature.


It was a hierarchy that was very independent, yet tied down by many things.


The decision of Cheonrimdaeju, which had already been made without much fanfare, wasted one opportunity. From the second time on, notarization by the residents of Iphwangseong was required.


Jeong Yeon-shin’s words had an impact like a shell.


People gathered.




The central training ground of Iphwangseong was filled with people. There were hundreds of people, from the main castle’s military personnel to guests.


Craftsmen and merchants, officials and servants mingled. A tremendous sense of oppression filled the air in the training hall.


“I came from near Seomseong. The new swordsmanship of the Magwangikju is said to be the best. They say that when you see my age, you are considered a spirit and not a human.”


“I will broaden my horizons with the Cold Sky Ice-Freedom Skill of the Seonmokryeongju. It is said to be a martial art that pacified the Saewoemurim. If I had focused more on the Anbeop, I wouldn’t have been so anxious… … I am afraid that I will not be able to see it in my eyes.”


Curiosity and excitement were running rampant.


The clash between the great masters was a spectacular sight even to those who did not know martial arts.


It was a rare sight in life. It was a sight that even the best of the best rarely saw unless they were wearing the black promotion ceremonies.


The two great leaders were already facing each other on the stage.


The Ma Gwang Ik Ju, which exposes the tendons of his left arm, and the Seonmok Ryeong Ju, whose forehead is covered by his ebony-like bangs.


They wore the same black robes and had similar heights. Both of their prayers were extraordinary. The atmosphere was also similar.


The energy flowing out of his entire body was transparently flowing. The only difference was the ears of the Sunmok Spirit Lord, which were sticking out like the tips of leaves.


While they were both silent, Jeong Yeon-shin opened her mouth.


“Let’s get started.”


I didn’t necessarily feel grateful. The great lords under the Shingeomdan always had to face challenges. They couldn’t refuse the approaching swordsman.


The personnel affairs of Ip Hwang Seong were close to battle. Jeong Yeon Shin would also one day receive a request for a secret weapon from his junior, Heuk Saek.


I still don’t know what kind of person Seonmokryeongju Cheon Soso is. After the battle today, I will experience it properly tomorrow at Wonpyeongilgeomjang.


Right now I only know one thing.


It was said that he looked down on the Han people just as much as Xiahou Weijin. There were many who said that he was an eccentric person who rarely spoke out even in the Yuanping Ilgeomjang.


He said that he couldn’t talk to anyone other than Mayeonjeok, the Grand General, the New Sword Master, and Aksurim.


“… … .”




As expected, she didn’t answer. She just silently continued to build up her internal energy.


Sarak.


The hem of her black robe swayed in the aftermath of the sudden qi attack. A divine white current enveloped her entire body.


He was surrounded by cold winds like a god of the north wind and snow. He was in the realm of true energy type formation. He displayed an incredible sense of mystery due to his internal energy.


Exclamations erupted from all over. There were even exclamations that it was the second coming of the Nine Heavenly Women.


Jeongyeonshin had a gut feeling. It was a divine skill.


‘Gwangryun.’


He commanded the wheel of light that his heart held.


Kiiing!


It was a sound from within. The core of the Neungbeop Gwangryungi was spinning like a whirlwind.


The internal energy that occurred during the interruption reached the lower abdomen below the navel. The internal energy accumulated in the lower abdomen reacted like a flash of light.


Outside the body, auspicious energy waves rose like wildfire.


The next moment.


Phew.


My eyes were filled with Cheon So-so’s face.


Her technique was incredibly fast. The distance between us was shortened in an instant. It seemed like she preferred speed and decisiveness.


My eyes met the calm, settled wall. The eyes, which seemed to hold the frost of the blue sky, were sparkling.


In the realm of thoughts that have become as fast as a flash, her hair, which has been flying back with the energy, sweeps up the side of Jeongyeonshin’s head.


A bitterly cold air hit my face.


She did not give up the initiative.


I couldn’t tell if it was his natural personality or if he felt some kind of anxiety from Jeong Yeon-shin.


Hwaaaaak―!


It was a side.


A pure white wind swept across the sky. It seemed as if snowflakes were fluttering.


I had experienced an ice storm before, but the hand approaching me from outside my field of vision was different.


A strange feeling was tickling the upper part of Jeongyeonshin’s head. It contained a spirituality that further enhanced the power of martial arts.


It’s a divine power. It can’t be opposed unless it’s the Neungbeop Gwangryungi.


Tsk tsk.


Even before I touched him, my whole body became numb. I was at the point where I was applying my own method without even making contact. It was different from the usual Han Bing Ji.


The cold that had seeped into his skin hardened his blood vessels and rose up through the twelve meridians. His black robe crackled and froze.


It seemed as if Cheon So-so had drawn all the moisture from the surrounding area. It was an extremely unrealistic sight.


A fleeting moment.


Jeongyeonshin exhaled through her mouth. It was a very short exhalation.


A light arose inside the body.


The Neungbeop Gwangryungi rushed forward with the momentum of burning every vein in his body. The internal energy he had built up in advance filled the meridians and blood vessels in his body.


The movement of the Jin Qi was incredibly intense. The speed of the halo’s rotation was literally like a flash of light.


Even though I didn’t cause any separate Samadhi evolution, a terrifying dynamic arose.


Then, the moment Jeong Yeon-shin grabbed Cheon So-so’s right hand.


Kwajik!


The frost that had wrapped around the two people’s bodies shattered into pieces.


Between the sunlight shining down brightly on the body, ice chips scatter, casting a rainbow of light.


“… … ?”


Cheon So-so’s face showed expression for the first time. She looked somewhat dazed.


“now.”


Jeongyeon Shin, who was holding her wrist with her left hand, pursed her lips.


“The junior will be released.”


Saaaaa―


The shards of cold air that had been spreading out like frost stopped moving. The hem of Magwangikju’s clothes continued to flutter.


It is the absorption and emission of the whole body from the beginning. The new method of the wind god has caused the season to move in a different way.


Ice chips floated around the black cloth.


Kwakwakwakwa!


With his right hand, he formed a magical formation. The opposing energies from the No-gung and So-bu points on his palm met like lightning and tore them apart.


The blood resonator and magical power separated from the light wheel created a thunderous noise.


Mancheonhwawoo, Hwankang.


“… … !”


Some of the more knowledgeable members of the crowd jumped to their feet.
