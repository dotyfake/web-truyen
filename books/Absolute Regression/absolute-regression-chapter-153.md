# Absolute Regression Chapter 153 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Geommu-geuk khiêu khích phe ác bằng kiếm vũ, nhận ra rằng chiêu thức Donggwijin có thể gây nguy hiểm cho cả những kẻ mạnh như Ma Vương nếu nội lực không đủ. Hắn muốn kéo Yang Cheo-gi xuống địa ngục cùng, nhưng Cheo-gi quyết tâm dùng Thiên Quang Tức Sát Thuật (Cheon-Gwang-Jeok-Sal-Sul).

Trong lúc đó, Ác Soma (evil soma) lo sợ Geommu-geuk chết sẽ khiến phe ác gặp nguy hiểm nên đã ra tay hỗ trợ. Yang Cheo-gi, vì dồn nội lực cho chiêu thức, nên bị đẩy lùi. Bất ngờ, một thanh kiếm đâm xuyên ngực Yang Cheo-gi. Hóa ra kẻ tấn công là một cao thủ ẩn mình do Ác Gokju (evil gokju) bí mật phái đến.

Trước khi chết, Yang Cheo-gi kịp bộc phát sức mạnh, khiến kẻ tấn công lẫn kẻ vừa phóng quang đều nổ mắt mà chết. Ác Soma lạnh lùng nhìn xác chết, trong khi Ác Gokju mừng rỡ vì sống sót. Geommu-geuk hứa sẽ tha mạng cho Ác Gokju nếu hắn khai ra manh mối về Cheonmyeonghoeju (Thiên Mệnh Hội Chủ).

Ác Gokju khai rằng Cheonmyeonghoeju luôn che giấu thân phận, liên lạc bí mật và chỉ quan tâm đến tiền bạc để duy trì vị trí của mình. Hắn tiết lộ manh mối quan trọng: Cheonmyeonghoeju có liên quan đến Tiểu Long Chiến (Little Dragon Battle), một giải đấu võ thuật do Murim Alliance (Võ Lâm Minh) tổ chức. Geommu-geuk nhận ra thời điểm này trùng với sự kiện Tiểu Long Chiến mà hắn biết.

Geommu-geuk giữ lời hứa tha mạng cho Ác Gokju, nhưng khi Geommu-geuk và phe mình rời đi, đám người Guiyi Geochang, Eunwol, và những kẻ khác tràn vào, giết chết Ác Gokju. Geommu-geuk bày tỏ lòng biết ơn với các Ma Vương (demons) vì sự giúp đỡ của họ. Ilhwageomjon nói đùa rằng nhờ vậy mà ông được hít thở không khí trong lành.

Geommu-geuk quyết định đến Murim Alliance để tìm hiểu về Cheonmyeonghoeju. Vì kỳ thi kế vị có liên quan đến việc bắt giữ Thiên Mệnh, anh cho rằng không tham gia còn nguy hiểm hơn. Anh cần một người tham gia Tiểu Long Chiến thay mình, một người hoàn toàn vô danh. Geommu-geuk đề cử Seo Dae-ryong, đệ tử của mình, và sẽ nhờ Tongcheon-gak tạo một thân phận ngụy trang hoàn hảo cho cậu. Geommu-geuk cũng nói rằng sẽ cử người đến điều tra sự kiện này.

Sau khi chia tay các Ma Vương, Geommu-geuk tức tốc đến Vũ Hán, Hồ Bắc, nơi đặt trụ sở của Võ Lâm Minh. Anh mua đồ dùng cần thiết và lên núi luyện tập. Anh luyện tập quên mình, quên cả người thân, nhiệm vụ và báo thù. Một tháng sau, anh cạo trọc đầu, để râu rậm, mặc quần áo rách rưới để tránh bị chú ý.

Tại một quán trọ đã hẹn, Geommu-geuk gặp lại Seo Dae-ryong. Cậu ấy có vẻ lo lắng khi đến lãnh thổ của Võ Lâm Minh. Seo Dae-ryong không nhận ra Geommu-geuk ngay lập tức vì vẻ ngoài khác lạ của anh. Geommu-geuk tiết lộ rằng anh đã gọi cậu đến để cùng nhau làm một việc.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-152/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-154/)Episode 153: I didn’t plan on taking you with me.




The sword dance was deliberately provoking him.


The evil soma said that the Donggwijin technique cannot be avoided if the internal energy is low. That means that the demon lords could also be in danger. The evil gokju also had to hear the clue about the Cheonmyeonghoeju, so he couldn’t die.


However, Geommu-geuk was more confident in his internal energy than anyone else here. No matter how profound Yang Cheo-gi’s internal energy was, he would never be able to surpass himself, who had already absorbed the internal energy of the Paradise Demon King in addition to the internal energy of the Demon Lords.


“Come with me to the underworld. I talk a lot, so at least you won’t get bored.”


The two eyes of the two men who thought they were being taunted turned even redder. Even though it was a momentary moment when it seemed as if the Heavenly Light Instant Killing Technique would be unleashed at any moment, the sword dance stimulated him even more.


“You only dream dreams that you can’t achieve until you die.”


Those words were like the sore scales of a sheep’s stomach. The wounds of a life that had not achieved anything, whether it was the devil, the lord of the universe, the leader of the world, or the lord of the valley. were too deep.


The moment when Yang Cheo-gi made up his mind, ‘Yes, it’s you.’


Phew!


The evil song of the villain who was just waiting for an opportunity flew towards the back of the sheep.




From the perspective of the evil lyricist, Geommugeuk absolutely could not die. If Geommugeuk died, the demons would not have allowed him to live.


The sheep herd turned around like lightning and swung its wings.


With an ear-piercing roar, both the evil song master and the Yangcheogi were pushed back. The Yangcheogi was pushed back even further. It wasn’t because his internal energy was lacking, but because he had raised his internal energy to use the Cheon-Gwang-Jeok-Sal-Sul, and so he couldn’t fully display his usual skills.


The angry sheep herdsman spit out blood.


Peeing!


And the sound heard was not the sound of a blood clot piercing through the body, but the sound of a sword piercing through the body.


Phew!


The bloodshot eyes missed the target’s evil face. Blood spurted from the tip of Yang Cheo Gi’s outstretched finger.


He slowly lowered his head and looked at his chest. A sharp, blue blade was sticking out from his back to his chest.


The shepherd slowly turned around with his sword still attached.




I thought it was a surprise attack by either the Swordmaster or the Majon, but they were still standing where they were.


The figure of a strange man who had made a surprise attack was seen. He was the last of the evil song masters and a master of stealth and swordsmanship. The evil song master’s last move was not Seok-no, but him. The secret move that he had hidden without telling Yang Cheo-gi worked properly.


The sheep’s knees slowly folded. He had neither the strength nor the opportunity to turn his head and choose someone else.


“Damn… … I didn’t mean to… … take you… … with me.”


At that moment, a red light burst out from Yang Cheo-gi’s eyes.


Bam! Bam!


The man who had made the surprise attack fell backwards with both eyes bursting out. At the same time, the man who had been pouring out light also died with both eyes bursting out.


If I didn’t do this, I would die without even being able to use the Thousand Light Instant Killing Technique, so I had no choice but to join forces with the man who had launched a surprise attack. An opponent whose name I didn’t even know.


He died without being able to use his last secret to the person he wanted. As the saying goes in the Geommu drama, he only dreamed of dreams that he could not achieve until his last moment.


The evil soma looked at his corpse indifferently. Although the death of Sa-baek marked the end of a long-standing grudge, he showed no emotion. He was neither relieved nor sad.




On the other hand, the evil singer was smiling.


In the end, he was the one who survived. Although even his subordinate, who had been a desperate measure, had died, it was important that he had survived at this moment.


“As promised, spare my life!”


Neither the death of his wife nor the death of his subordinate meant anything to him.


Geommugeuk looked at him coldly and said.


“It’s up to you whether you live or die.”


The evil song writer started talking about Cheonmyeonghoeju.


“Cheonmyeonghoeju never revealed his identity. When he met us, he showed up wearing a bamboo hat with a cotton thread. When we contacted him, he refused to meet us, and he always contacted us to set up a time and place.”


“How did Cheonmyeonghoeju get you involved?”


“What could it be? Money.”


He was offered a large sum of money that could move him.


“Don’t make fun of me. Money is the seat. You don’t know how unstable this seat is. How many crazy people want to sit in it just once, even if it means dying.”


Money was what could keep that position.


Even the goblins and the iron smiths were capable of aiming for the position of the bar at any time. The only thing that could restrain their ambitions was the money that allowed them to enjoy pleasure.


“Didn’t you say there was a clue that could help us find him?”


“That’s right. Instead, promise me here. You will spare my life. Swear on your religion.”


“I swear by my church. If you give me a clue to find the Heavenly Mandate, I will spare your life.”


Only then did the evil songwriter give a clue.


“Would I have blindly trusted a man called Cheonmyeonghoeju? I secretly investigated his background. But it wasn’t easy. Those I sent to investigate went missing or were found dead. But I sent them again and again. And in the end, I found out one thing.”


An unexpected word came out of the mouth of the evil song master.




“Little Dragon Battle.”


The Little Dragon Tournament is a martial arts competition held by the Murim Alliance, where talented individuals are selected from among the later leaders of the Jeongpa and brought into the elite ranks of the Murim Alliance.


“This is information that the three craftsmen have obtained by risking their lives. Cheonmyeonghoeju is definitely planning something related to this Little Dragon War!”


The evil songwriter trembled with anxiety, fearing that people would say that this was not enough.


But there was no need for that. The Sword Dance was thinking of one fact related to the Little Dragon Chronicles.


‘Ah! Now that I think about it, this was that year!’


The sword dance nodded.


“Okay. I’ll consider that information useful.”


“Then will you spare me?”


“I will keep my promise. I hope you survive well.”


“?”


As the sword dance and the demons turned their backs and left the main hall, the villains were waiting outside.


The spear-wielding Guiyi Geochang and his men, as well as Eunwol and his assassins, the drugged men and the group consisting of women, hunters and beggars. They were the ones who had not attacked us before.


As soon as we came out, they began to rush into the main hall one by one, their eyes full of life and greed.


A swear word was heard inside, followed by the sound of a fight. Several people screamed, and the scream of the evil singer was also heard.

This clearly shows why the evil songs cannot come out into the world as an organization. This place was hell.


\* \* \*


At the entrance to the evil song, I formally expressed my gratitude to the demons.


“Thank you for your help.”


Then the Bloodthirsty Demon said.


“Did we do anything? We fought among ourselves and died.”


“It happened because everyone was there. Imagine if I had gone alone. I would have been covered in blood and causing a scene right now.”


I made eye contact with each of the Amazons.


The eyes in the sockets of the evil soma were expressing deep gratitude.


This would never have happened, but thanks to my intervention, he was able to settle an old grudge.


Ilhwageomjon said with a smile.


“Thanks to you, I was able to get some fresh air and it was nice.”


The Ilhwageomjon who said he would not become a wing played the role of a great wing this time. The more people say they do not belong somewhere, the more they fall into that somewhere. It may be that they are on guard in advance because they know that they are falling deeper than anyone else.


Next to him, Chuma was drinking alcohol. He was the one who had started to move in earnest to reconcile Hyeolcheon Doma and Ilhwa Geomjon. Although he had made mistakes in his youth, he now acknowledges them and is trying to correct them. I like it, hyung.


Finally, I met his eyes. If he hadn’t come to the Hwangha Guesthouse earlier, I might have died.


I didn’t say thank you. I think you already knew how I felt through my eyes.


I don’t know how things will end with these people. Will things go wrong after being this good? Or will our relationship become deeper than I can even imagine right now?


Even though I knew what was going to happen in the Little Dragon Chronicles, my relationship with these newly created people was something I had never done before. I just did my best at that moment.


“What are you going to do now?”


I answered Hyeolcheon Doma’s question without hesitation.




“I have to go to the Murim Alliance.”


The Little Dragon Tournament will be held at the main headquarters of the Murim Alliance in about two months.


“It might be dangerous.”


“This successor exam is about capturing the Thousand Mandates. It would be more dangerous for me to fail the exam.”


“So? You’re going to attend the Little Dragon Show yourself?”


“No, if I participate, I will eventually be found out, so I need to stay around. There is someone else who can attend besides me. Someone who is completely unknown in the martial arts world.”


“Who is that?”


Then, an unexpected person came out of Geommugeuk’s mouth.


“I am your disciple, sir.”


Looking at the surprised Hyeoncheon Doma, Geommugeuk smiled and said.


“We will have investigators attend this event.”


If you ask Tongcheon-gak, they will create a perfect camouflage sect for you. Seodaeryong will be a member of that sect.


“What role do you want to play?”


“If you were a servant or a bodyguard, you wouldn’t stand out.”


The Amazons looked at me with a look that said, “Wouldn’t that really be noticeable?”


He tried to follow me because he was worried about the blood clot.


“I’ll go too.”


Then, Geommu-geuk’s gaze turned to the Myeolcheondaedo.


“Everyone will think that sword is fake, right? Surely the Murim Alliance wouldn’t bring the Bloody Heavenly Sword to the Heavenly Destruction. Right?”


It’s a roundabout way of saying that it’s too obvious and that it won’t work.




The mask of the evil soma and the white flower sword of Ilhwageomjon engraved with red camellia flowers were also well known in the martial arts world.


If Ian went, he would attract all eyes, and the same goes for the big Jangho’s facial scar. In this case, Seo Dae-ryong was the perfect fit.


“It sounds fun. Brother, I want to go too.”


How could a drunk person not stand out?


“I’ll tell you everything that happened later while we were drinking. Oh, and I might ask you for help again regarding the Cheonmyeonghoeju. I still have two out of three opportunities to ask for help. Please take care of me then as well.”


The demons nodded. The Geommu-geuk was strong. If they could help, they would be confident that they could have a go at the Murim Alliance.


‘Now, right arm. Let’s make a name for ourselves in the Murim Alliance.’


\* \* \*


After parting ways with the Demon Lords, I headed straight to Wuhan, Hubei Province, where the Martial Arts Alliance was located.


I ran at extreme speeds at a speed sprint. I ran and ran, between trees, between people, and jumping over rocks.


No one recognized me. Even the beasts that were chasing me gave up and couldn’t catch up with me. In a flash, I disappeared into the distance.


The earlier I arrived, the more time I could spend practicing martial arts, so I ran and ran at the fastest pace I could.


After arriving at the headquarters of the Murim Alliance, they bought food that could last a long time and items necessary for mountain life at a market and then went into the mountains.


It was still a long way for the Western Dragon who had received the letter to come here, and the Little Dragon Temple was even farther away.


Until then, I planned to just stay quietly in the mountains and practice.


From that day on, I devoted myself to training.


Forgetting people, forgetting missions, forgetting revenge.


I trained as if I was born solely to train in martial arts. I trained with the mindset that I would sleep after I die. I ate and trained, practiced and trained, practiced and trained.


A month later, I was walking down the street looking like a bald guy.


I deliberately did not cut the beard I had grown over the years. I threw away the martial arts uniform I had worn while training and bought a set of shabby, cheap clothes that were not noticeable.




When I went to the appointed guest house, Seo Dae-ryong was waiting for me.


He looked visibly nervous as he entered the Murim Alliance territory.


It was so nice to see him after such a long time. Even though our eyes met briefly, he didn’t recognize me.


Then, when I sat down in front of him, I recognized him belatedly and was surprised.


“each……!”


Seo Dae-ryong’s mouth was shut before the word footnote could be said.


“You want to spread the word that I came?”


“No, that’s not possible. I was just surprised.”


My hair is unkempt, and I have a beard like a bandit. If Seo Dae-ryong didn’t recognize me at first glance, then no one will recognize me.


“But why do you look like this?”


“It’s a stomach.”


“Ah! What’s with the beard? This dirty disguise? They’ll just stare at you even more.”


He was saying that, but he was also doing the same. He was wearing a white uniform with the character for “정” (正) engraved on his chest.


“Look at me. Anyone who sees me like this would think I’m a political dictator.”


“Look around you. Who is wearing clothes like that? It’s exactly the kind of clothes that a rookie in the martial arts world would wear for a few days and then throw in a corner.”


“But I think it’s better than that dirty beard.”


“It’s not even dirty, it’s dirty!”


We looked at each other and laughed together. After that happy reunion where we attacked each other’s appearances, Seo Dae-ryong asked seriously.


“But why did you call me here?”


Seo Dae-ryong came here without hearing any story in advance. I spoke to Seo Dae-ryong with a meaningful smile, who was very nervous.




“Let’s do something together.”
