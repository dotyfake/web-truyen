## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Jin Ha-ryeong đến quán trọ một mình, gọi hai bát mì và rượu. Sự xuất hiện của cô khiến Seo Dae-ryong chú ý, nhưng cô không để tâm. Bất ngờ, cô hỏi nhân vật chính (tôi) có tham gia Giải Tiểu Long (Little Dragon Tournament) không. Cậu trả lời rằng chủ nhân của cậu (tôi) sẽ tham gia, khiến Jin Ha-ryeong ngạc nhiên.

Sau đó, một người đàn ông, có vẻ là vệ sĩ của Jin Ha-ryeong, đến và thúc giục cô rời đi. Trước khi đi, cô nói với anh ta: "Nếu anh ăn nhanh như vậy, anh sẽ chết đói trước khi bị đâm chết." (If you eat that fast, you’ll die of hunger before you get stabbed to death.) Sau khi cô rời đi, Seo Dae-ryong bày tỏ sự ngưỡng mộ đối với Jin Ha-ryeong, nhưng cậu lại bị cậu (nhân vật chính) nói rằng cô là cháu gái của minh chủ võ lâm, và cậu cũng sẽ phải đối đầu với cô ta trong giải đấu.

Ngày hôm sau, Seo Dae-ryong tham gia trận đấu đầu tiên của mình. Cậu rất lo lắng nhưng đã chiến thắng dễ dàng. Cậu được thông báo sẽ có trận đấu thứ hai vào buổi chiều. Đến chiều, cậu lại tiếp tục giành chiến thắng. Cậu (nhân vật chính) nhận xét rằng cậu ấy đã tiến bộ rất nhiều nhờ khổ luyện.

Trong khi đó, cậu (nhân vật chính) quan sát các trận đấu khác và thấy Jin Ha-ryeong cũng đang thi đấu và chiến thắng. Cậu nhớ lại rằng Jin Ha-ryeong đã vô địch giải đấu này trong quá khứ, và giờ cậu biết Thiên Mệnh Hội (Cheonmyeonghoe) đứng sau giải đấu. Cậu nhận ra rằng giải đấu này là khởi đầu cho vận mệnh của Jin Ha-ryeong và là cơ hội để cậu tiếp cận Thiên Mệnh Hội.

Ngày hôm sau, Seo Dae-ryong tiếp tục giành chiến thắng. Cậu (nhân vật chính) xem trận đấu của Jin Ha-ryeong. Cậu suy nghĩ về khả năng Seo Dae-ryong sẽ phải đối đầu với cô trong tương lai. Cậu cũng quan tâm đến cô vì cô là mục tiêu của âm mưu mà Thiên Mệnh Hội đang thực hiện.

Ngày tiếp theo, Seo Dae-ryong suýt bị thương trong trận đấu, khiến cậu muốn bỏ cuộc. Tuy nhiên, cậu đã cảm thấy tốt hơn vào ngày hôm sau khi nhận được sự chú ý và ngưỡng mộ từ mọi người. Một cô gái còn đến chào cậu và cổ vũ cậu, khiến cậu vô cùng vui sướng. Cậu (nhân vật chính) hy vọng cậu ấy sẽ trân trọng những khoảnh khắc này.

Seo Dae-ryong tiếp tục giành chiến thắng và tiến vào vòng đấu chính. Cậu (nhân vật chính) đã nói với cậu rằng: "Càng trở thành cao thủ, người ta càng muốn được người khác ngưỡng mộ." (The more you become an expert, the more they will want to look after you.)

Cuối cùng, Seo Dae-ryong đã giành chiến thắng ở Hoàng Giáp Tổ (Hwangjajo) và tiến vào giải đấu chính thức. Cậu (nhân vật chính) muốn cậu ấy tận hưởng những khoảnh khắc này, vì đây là những khoảnh khắc quý giá trong cuộc đời cậu.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-154/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-156/)The more I become a master, the hotter my passion becomes.




Jin Ha-ryeong ordered noodles and alcohol.


She came alone and for some reason ordered two bowls of noodles.


Her expressionless face and soft tone made people nervous, and neither Jeom So-i, who was taking orders, nor Seo Dae-ryong, who was sitting across from her, could properly look her in the eye.


And she had a knack for finding people who weren’t nervous around her.


Our eyes met and a strange light flashed across her eyes. It must have been rare for someone to look at their own face so calmly.


But soon she turned her gaze elsewhere.


The sound of Seodaeryong’s voice came flying in.


-They are really pretty. The Jeongpa women are really so pretty.


Seo Dae-ryong’s voice came to mind.


Even though she felt Seo Dae-ryong’s gaze secretly peeking at her, she paid no attention to it as if it was a familiar routine.




Soon after, two bowls of noodles and alcohol came out.


As she was about to pour a drink, Seo Dae-ryong mustered up his courage.


“Let me pour you a drink.”


Jin Ha-ryeong stared at Seo Dae-ryong.


“There is no other meaning. It’s just fate that we are sitting in the same place.”


But Jin Ha-ryeong drank alone without saying a word.


The sound of self-reproach that the world was falling apart came flying in.


―Oh, I said it so cliche. Sitting in the same place is fate! Oh! My grandfather wouldn’t have said something like that.


At that moment, Jin Ha-ryeong put down his glass and asked me.


“Are you participating in the Little Dragon Tournament?”




He looked at her for a moment, then looked at Seo Dae-ryong and said.


“Our master is attending.”


“young master?”


“Yes. I am a servant serving the young master.”


Jin Ha-ryeong looked at me and Seo Dae-ryong alternately with a look of surprise. It was as if he was the master and the other person was the servant, and Seo Dae-ryong was pestering me for no reason.


“It’s because the young man has grown a beard. You rascal! Doesn’t that dirty beard confuse you?”


“I’m sorry, your highness.”


Soon she started eating her noodles as if she didn’t care what happened.


The sound of Seodaeryong’s voice came flying in.


-Looking at this again, this woman doesn’t look that great.




I smiled inside as I watched Seo Dae-ryong pouting.


At that moment, a man in his early thirties entered the guesthouse. Judging from his visible prayers and gait, he was a considerable expert and looked like one of Jin Ha-ryeong’s bodyguards.


“I searched for a long time.”


“sit down.”


“You have to go now.”


“Please sit down. We’re not the only ones here, right?”


The man looked us over quickly and then sat down next to her.


She pushed the noodles in front of him.


“Eat. The noodles here are delicious.”


She ordered two bowls of noodles because she knew this man would come looking for her.


“it’s okay.”


“I’m not okay. Come on, eat.”


“yes.”


The man started eating the noodles. He slurped down the noodles and quickly emptied the broth.


If Ian was there, he would have said he understood the man. The escort drones have no choice but to eat their food quickly, which is a habit.


At that time, Jin Ha-ryeong said to him.


“If you eat that fast, you’ll die of hunger before you get stabbed to death.”


“I am okay.”


“You’re okay. It’s always because I’m not okay.”


The man got up from his seat and urged her on.




“You should go now. They will be looking for the young lady.”


“Okay, I should go.”


Jin Ha-ryeong emptied her drink, got up from her seat, and went out with the man.


As she disappeared into the distance, Seo Dae-ryong spoke with hazy eyes.


“I came here as if it was fate and I just ate noodles and left.”


“When you look at it again, it doesn’t look that good?”


“I’m a narrow-minded beggar, but that woman isn’t ugly. She’s the prettiest woman I’ve ever seen.”


“That woman is no good.”


“Why? You’re saying that I, who looks like a servant, can’t be allowed to be? Right?”


“Even I, a wonderful man like you, can’t hide the fact that I’m a master no matter how long I grow my beard.”


“Why, my lord?”


“The love between the son of Cheonma and the granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world is a fateful love.”


Seo Dae-ryong was shocked at the words, “The granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world.”


“The granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world?”


“okay.”

“Why is the granddaughter of the Murim Alliance eating noodles in a guest house like this? And she even joins the table?”


“I don’t know. Maybe he ran away because he was tired of the banquet hall with its expensive and rare dishes. Or maybe he wanted to eat the noodles from this restaurant.”


“Ah! Life is so unpredictable. Who would have thought that I would end up sitting with the granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world at the inn in front of the martial arts world?”


“And that’s not all? You’ll also be fighting with the granddaughter of the martial arts leader.”


Seo Dae-ryong was even more surprised.


“What are you talking about?”


“She’ll be in the Little Dragon Tale too.”


Seo Dae-ryong’s eyes widened.


That’s why I remember this Little Dragon Tournament. It was the tournament that made her name known to everyone.


The winner of this competition was Jin Ha-ryeong.


At the time, I just let it go, thinking it was just a coincidence. It wasn’t all that surprising that the granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world won the competition of the later ranks.


But now I know that Cheonmyeonghoe is behind this event.


This competition was also the starting point for Jin Ha-ryeong’s fate to flow in a way that would surprise the world.


“Go for it, Inspector Seo.”


Seo Dae-ryong, who realized that I was being sincere, drank the wine in front of him.


“You are saying something that I cannot answer when I am of sound mind.”


\* \* \*


The next day, Seo Dae-ryong’s first battle took place.


The outer garden of the Murim Alliance was decorated with dozens of stages, each of which was crowded with participants and spectators.


But even though there were so many people, the ceremony was proceeding smoothly and in an orderly manner.




There is a certain sense of pressure that the Murim Alliance gives. Also, the martial artists who are conducting the martial arts competition are members of the Blue Dragon Group, one of the elite organizations of the Murim Alliance, so there was no one who caused trouble or disturbance.


The military officer in charge of the Hwangjajo that Seo Dae-ryong belonged to came and gave instructions.


“If you intentionally injure or kill your opponent, you will be disqualified. You may also be charged with a crime and imprisoned in the brain, so be careful. This match is not a fair fight where life and death are at stake.”


The first opponent was a warrior from the Hubei swordsmanship school. He had a rather stocky physique and sharp eyes.


“I’m shaking to death.”


“Are you this nervous when you take the investigator promotion exam at Hwangcheon-gak?”


“I didn’t feel nervous at all then.”


“It’s the same, isn’t it? You tried.”


Seo Dae-ryong opened his eyes wide and looked at me.


“I know you trained harder than anyone else. That’s why you’re here. If it weren’t for that, I would have grown a bigger beard and gone up.”


Seo Dae-ryong nodded vigorously, as if my words had given him strength.


“I will come back winning.”


Seodaeryong came down after defeating his opponent in just three moves. He even won without drawing his sword.


“Isn’t it too easy?”


“Don’t forget whose disciple you are.”


Seo Dae-ryong finally had the opportunity to objectively look at his own abilities. He still does not know how important this is to the unmanned Seo Dae-ryong.


At that time, the unmanned person conducting the ceremony came and informed us.


“The next rainy day is in the afternoon, so don’t go anywhere and wait.”


It seemed like they were having two fights a day because it was still early in the competition.


“So if I get hurt in the morning match, I have to play in the afternoon match while still injured. Are you saying that you want to test my fighting spirit?”




“What about fighting spirit? It must be because you have a busy schedule.”


“Don’t make fun of our party’s fighting spirit!”


“Yes, Master! Let’s burn with fighting spirit!”


In the afternoon, Seodaeryong won easily. This time, he won without even using the sword.


“How do you feel about the first day of winning streak?”


“Is it good?”


Although Seo Dae-ryong had studied hard under Hyeoncheon Doma, he had never actually practiced martial arts before.


“I was very nervous before going up there, but once I got on stage, I wasn’t that nervous. It was a strange experience.”


“I told you it would be a good experience.”


“I have never regretted listening to your words.”


“Go first and rest.”


“What about you, sir?”


“I’ll go look around.”


“Okay, then I’ll go first.”


After sending Seo Dae-ryong away first, I looked back at the stage.


The non-stage performances were still in full swing.


At that time, I saw that a certain stage was unusually crowded with people watching. When I went to see it, I saw Jin Ha-ryeong, who I had seen yesterday, on the stage.


She was the granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world and was so beautiful that she was called the most beautiful woman in the North, so she was the center of attention. People watching talked about her.


“But why did the leader’s granddaughter participate in this competition?”


“Even if she’s my granddaughter, I won’t just give her a seat. If she wants to join the Murim Alliance, she has to do it with her skills, right?”




“That’s right, that’s right. Didn’t Lady Jin’s brother win a competition a few years ago and join the Martial Arts Alliance?”


“As expected! Our leader is a fair and just man.”


Jin Ha-ryeong also subdued his opponent without even drawing his sword.


She came down from the stage to cheers and left without even looking at anyone. People were even more excited by her confident appearance.


I returned to the guest house after looking around the other battles a bit more. Seo Dae-ryong went to the mountains to train and came back late at night. Although he won easily today, he seemed to be concerned about the remaining battles.


“As I said, I’m the type of person who can’t learn unless I get first place. If I don’t go, then I don’t go. If I go, then I have to do my best.”


How could Seo Dae-ryong’s podium just appear like that? It must be a personality that was created through hard work.


Seo Dae-ryong won the match the next day as well.


“Are you saying you didn’t even watch my match?”


“Because there are interesting matches on other non-stages.”


“Who are you? Surely you’re not the granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world?”


“that’s right.”


This time, I watched Jin Ha-ryeong’s match. Considering Seo Dae-ryong’s skill, she might have to face her. Of course, since the groups are different, it wouldn’t be right away, but if she became the group winner and advanced to the main tournament, she might have to face her.


And there was a more important reason to care about her. She was the target and center of the conspiracy that this Cheonmyeonghoe was plotting. She would surely be the conduit that would connect me to them.


“What if I meet a strong opponent?”


“You just went there? You went there after seeing who your opponent was. You attacked the left weak point and won, right?”


“Huh? How did you know?”


“Watch him walk.”


I relieved the admiring Seo Dae-ryong. Now is the moment for me to admire him.


“Does it feel good to win?”




“Honestly, it’s awesome!”


“Good job.”


Seo Dae-ryong couldn’t hide the joy on his face.


“Do you know when I feel the best? Surprisingly, it wasn’t when I knocked down my opponent. When I finished my fight and came down from the stage, I felt the best. I was even more nervous and excited when people looked at me and cheered and applauded. This is when I realized that I am a person who is so conscious of other people’s gaze.”


“The more you become an expert, the more they will want to look after you.”


“How could that be?”


“Why? Do you think you’ll become more polite? More humble?”


“Isn’t it?”


“Let’s say someone becomes the best in the world. The moment you become the best in the world, is it good to have beaten the previous best in the world? Or is it good to have everyone respect and look up to you as the best in the world from that day on?”


Imagine that wherever you go, you shout, “The best in the world is coming!” Imagine that everyone you meet looks at you with admiration and envy. Imagine that you always hear the sound of victory drums, applause, and cheers.


“Everyone’s heart is the same. No, the more you become an expert, the more passionate and primitive your desires may become. The heart of the best in the world is broader? Is that really true? I am the best in the world, and you treat me like this? Are you confident that you won’t fall into this trap? Are you confident that you will bury that narrow-mindedness that you no longer have to hide?”


After a moment, Seo Dae-ryong said.


“But you’re not the footnote, are you? You’re not, are you?”


“Why do you think I’m not? Am I not a human? I’m the same. I’m just trying not to be.”


“I feel so good having this conversation with you, my lord. I feel like I’ve finally become a real person. I don’t know when my heart has been pounding like this. I sincerely apologize for insisting that I wouldn’t participate in this competition.”


But our Seo Dae-ryong’s mind changed the very next day.


“I almost died! I’m not joking, I really almost died! Oh my, I told you I wouldn’t do it! I want to go back!”


“It’s just a scratch. It’s okay.”


“You got scratched? Can’t you see the blood? Oh, if I had missed it by a hair’s breadth, there would have been a hole this big on my shoulder! And the sword was so big.”


“Your opponent can’t even get up right now.”


The opponent who had caused Seo Dae-ryong to see blood on his shoulder was unconscious and still not conscious.


“I don’t know, just send me home! I’m going to water the plants!”


Seo Dae-ryong, who had been like this, felt better again the next day.


Seo Dae-ryong was receiving the attention he wanted even from under the stage.


Even though he was just walking, there were many eyes glancing at him. They were even whispering among themselves.


“What is this?”


“Yesterday, that guy was a candidate to win the Prince’s Cup. Thanks to that, you’ve become one of the people who are getting attention in this competition.”


We took all the attention from the opponent we had defeated with difficulty yesterday.


“Don’t look at me, that blue one on the right. You looked at me twice. Oh, look again.”


“No matter what, can you please walk a little faster?”


Seo Dae-ryong was moving slowly, enjoying everyone’s attention.


“Oh! I think those women on the far left are whispering to me.”


“It looks to me like we’re discussing what to eat.”


At that moment, a young woman carrying a sword ran up and greeted Seo Dae-ryong.


“I enjoyed your match yesterday. Fight well today too.”


He bowed and left.


Seo Dae-ryong froze and stared blankly at her back.


“Your Majesty.”


“why?”


“You didn’t buy people with money just to make me feel better, did you?”


“I want to say yes, thinking about how much you brag, but no.”


“Really? This is like a dream.”


Seo Dae-ryong was really happy. It seemed like it was the first time a woman had come to him and shown such affection.


I hope he enjoys this joy and excitement. He will never forget his time here.


I want Seo Dae-ryong to sit his grandson on his lap and tell him a story from that time. A story that starts with, “It may be hard to believe, but this is when I was young.”


“Let’s go! To win!”


Was it thanks to the woman’s encouragement?


Seo Dae-ryong continued to win, and won the Hwangjajo easily, advancing to the main tournament. Now, the main tournament was a match between the top players from each group.


“I’ll go all the way!”


Seo Dae-ryong was burning apart from his mission. Yes, this is a moment that will not come often in life. It is a more thrilling, exciting, and valuable moment than when you grow old and become the best in the world. Yes, burn, Dae-ryong.
