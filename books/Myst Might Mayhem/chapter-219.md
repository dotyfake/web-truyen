 Chapter 219 – Craftsman (3)


 Everyone was baffled by Mok Gyeong-un’s sudden disappearance.


 Of course, Mok Gyeong-un’s group, consisting of the advance and rear teams, were amazed in a different sense, knowing that he had utilized an incredibly fast lightness skill.


 Then, Gan-yang, the leader of the advance team, spoke softly to Mong Mu-yak and Seop Chun from the rear team with a troubled expression.


 “Shouldn’t we have stopped Young Master Mok?”


 “Stop him? How could we have done that?”


 He had vanished before they could even say anything.


 How were they supposed to stop him?


 “If there’s friction with the Embroidered Uniform Guards now that the mask production has already gone awry, it could further disrupt our plan.”


 Gan-yang thought the human skin mask production was already a lost cause since the master’s arms had been severed.


 If they clashed with the Embroidered Uniform Guard under such circumstances, it could make infiltrating the imperial palace even more difficult.


 At his words, Seop Chun spoke as if telling him not to worry.


 “Just wait and see. Our lord is not someone who lacks judgment. And as for the mask production…”


 

 Seop Chun hesitated, unsure how to phrase it.


 He was about to say that if their lord, Mok Gyeong-un, could find the master’s severed hands, he could reattach them with his mysterious medical techniques, but he wasn’t sure if they would easily believe it.


 After all, it was hard to believe that severed arms could be reattached.


 Just then, someone suddenly rushed into the room, panting heavily.


 “Gasp! It’s… it’s a big problem.”


 “Brother Mo!”


 The hairy man recognized him and called him Brother Mo.


 Brother Mo then spoke to the slaughterhouse workers with a tearful voice, as if apologizing.


 “Miss… Miss Song-ah has been arrested by the Embroidered Uniform Guard for obstructing official duties.”


 “Wh-what? Obstructing official duties?”


 “No, Mr. Mo, you just watched it happen?”


 Shocked by the sudden news, the slaughterhouse workers were perplexed and outraged.


 At that moment…


 “These damn bastards!”


 -Pak!


 The hairy man, with an enraged face, pulled out a slaughter knife hanging on the room’s wall.


 He seemed ready to rush outside at any moment.


 Just then, someone scolded him.


 “Stop right there!”


 The hairy man, who was about to run out, frowned and stopped in his tracks.


 The one who stopped him was none other than the master.


 The master spoke with difficulty as he struggled to get up.


 “Haa… haa… What do you think you can accomplish by getting involved?”


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c4f98310f240f4d43d687", id: "pf-8947-1"}) “But Young Miss Song-ah…”


 “Do you want to make matters worse?”


 The master, who had reprimanded him, then looked at Seop Chun and his group and spoke.


 “Haa… haa… You’re martial artists, right?”


 At his words, Gan-yang, the leader of the advance team, nodded and replied.


 “That’s correct. But Master… You’re bleeding heavily, so don’t strain yourself and sit down for now…”


 -Thud!


 Before he could finish his sentence, the master knelt on the floor.


 “M-Master!”


 “Why are you…”


 The slaughterhouse workers became restless at his action.


 Nevertheless, the master ignored them and said what he wanted to say.


 “Haa… haa… I’m… fine. But I have a request for you.”


 “A request?”


 “Please help us.”


 Gan-yang was troubled by his plea.


 It was already a difficult situation with Mok Gyeong-un acting on his own, and if they also clashed with the Embroidered Uniform Guard, it could seriously hinder their mission.


 “Master… I understand your desire to save your daughter, but…”


 “Haa… haa… That child… cough cough… is not my daughter.”


 “What?”


 Didn’t everyone refer to her as the young miss?


 If so, she should be the master’s daughter, but what does he mean by that?


 Just then, the hairy man, who had been gripping the handle of the slaughter knife, also knelt on the floor like the master.


 “Please help us.”


 “Brother Song!”


 Surprised by his sudden action, the slaughterhouse workers tried to dissuade him.


 At that moment, the Demon-Subduing monk Ja Geum-jeong alternately glanced at the master and the hairy man called Brother Song, then burst into laughter.


 “Hahahahaha. Now I get it.”


 \*\*\*


 -Clang!


 The Embroidered Uniform Guard with droopy eyebrows couldn’t hide his bewilderment.


 ‘This guy… is an expert!’


 The Embroidered Uniform Guard with droopy eyebrows was a One Hundred-men Commander of the senior 6th rank, an expert at the entry-stage of the Peak Realm.


 If someone could block his sword strike, infused with his 7-star martial power, with a mere finger, it meant that the martial prowess of this unknown expert with a covered face far surpassed his own.


 ‘With an expert of this level, the four of us need to attack together, or the Thousand-men Commander needs to step in.’


 -Pat!


 Realizing he couldn’t handle it alone, the Embroidered Uniform Guard with droopy eyebrows hastily distanced himself and raised one hand behind his back, sending a hand signal to the other Embroidered Uniform Guards for help, and spoke.


 “Who are you to interfere with our Embroidered Uniform Guard’s affairs?”


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c50524a5a770dd7e4e350", id: "pf-8948-1"}) He deliberately emphasized their identity as the Embroidered Uniform Guard.


 Among the people of the Central Plains, there was no one who didn’t know that the Embroidered Uniform Guard were the emperor’s personal guards.


 He did so to instill a sense of caution in his opponent.


 No matter how skilled in martial arts, he wanted to convey how dangerous it was to provoke them.


 In response to his words, the person with the covered face, no, Mok Gyeong-un, whose face was covered with a black cloth, chuckled and said.


 “Oh? So you’re from the Embroidered Uniform Guard?”


 The Embroidered Uniform Guard frowned at Mok Gyeong-un’s tone, as if he was pretending not to know.


 Was he doing this on purpose?


 It made no sense for him to not know they were from the Embroidered Uniform Guard after seeing their golden belts and flying fish robes.


 The Embroidered Uniform Guard then spoke.


 “If you truly didn’t know, stop right here and back off. Then we won’t question your circumstances or accuse you of any crimes…”


 Before he could finish his sentence…


 -Swish!


 Mok Gyeong-un instantly closed the distance, appearing right in front of him.


 “Gasp!”


 Startled, he swung his sword behind him, trying to propel his body backward, but Mok Gyeong-un struck the acupuncture points of the Embroidered Uniform Guard with droopy eyebrows at lightning speed.


 -Tatatatatak!


 The Embroidered Uniform Guard, whose acupuncture points had been struck, closed his eyes and immediately fell unconscious.


 -Thud!


 Witnessing this, the other Embroidered Uniform Guards, who had dismounted from their horses to help the Embroidered Uniform Guard with droopy eyebrows and were stealthily approaching, couldn’t hide their bewilderment.


 One of them hurriedly tried to shout towards the carriage.


 “Comman—…”


 -Pak!


 Mok Gyeong-un then grabbed the neck of the Embroidered Uniform Guard with droopy eyebrows as if he would break it and wiggled his index finger from side to side at the Embroidered Uniform Guards.


 It was clear to anyone that if they shouted, he would snap their comrade’s neck.


 ‘H-He’s taking a hostage?’


 The Embroidered Uniform Guards, whose comrade had been taken hostage, stopped shouting and hesitated, unsure of what to do.


 At that moment, Mok Gyeong-un’s figure dispersed like smoke.


 -Swish!


 ‘B-Body Displacement Technique?’


 Body Displacement Technique.


 It is a phenomenon where one moves so fast that their figure appears as an afterimage.


 The startled Embroidered Uniform Guards tried to turn their backs to each other and assume a defensive stance.


 However, before they could even turn around, one of them, the Embroidered Uniform Guard with a beard, was struck on the chin.


 -Bam!


 “Ugh!”


 His head jerked upward, and then his eyes rolled back as he collapsed to the ground.


 -Thud!


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) ‘N-No way!’


 With another comrade taken down in an instant, the remaining two Embroidered Uniform Guards, startled, pressed their backs tightly against each other and frantically darted their eyes in all directions with extreme tension.


 However, not even Mok Gyeong-un’s shadow entered their sight.


 Their complexions gradually darkened under the suffocating tension.


 \*\*\*


 The name of the woman with thick eyebrows, freckles, and braided hair was Song-ah.


 She was the daughter of Hong Bong Meat’s master and also the head maid in charge of the slaughterhouse’s inner workings.


 Song-ah, whose mouth was gagged with a thick cloth, glared at the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard sitting with his arms crossed in front of her.


 She had desperately chased after the Embroidered Uniform Guards to demand her father’s severed hands, but now she found herself bound and confined inside the carriage.


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard spoke to her.


 “Have you calmed down a bit?”


 It was a heavy, baritone voice.


 Judging by his voice, he seemed like someone who wouldn’t speak much.


 Song-ah stared intently at the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard for a moment, then finally nodded.


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard then removed the cloth that had been gagging her mouth.


 “Puhaa… haa… haa…”


 She let out rough breaths, as if she had been suffocating.


 After catching her breath, she glared at the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard again and spoke.


 “Is the great Embroidered Uniform Guard not only taking my father’s hands but now kidnapping me as well?”


 “…”


 “Where are you trying to take me?”


 While most women would have been frightened after being arrested by the Embroidered Uniform Guard, she boldly confronted him.


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard, who had been staring at her, opened his mouth.


 “Watch your words. You were the one who followed the procession and caused a commotion.”


 “A commotion? Is it a commotion to try and stop you from taking my father’s hands like some trophy after severing them, even though he accepted the request from your esteemed superior?”


 “Be quiet and lower your voice.”


 “I won’t lower it!”


 “Do you want to be gagged again?”


 “Go ahead and do it. I’ll continue causing that so-called commotion until you return my father’s hands! Kyaaaaa…”


 -Tatatap!


 As Song-ah tried to scream, the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard pressed her mute acupuncture point.


 He then sighed and shook his head.


 She was not just bold but incredibly foolish.


 “Mmph!”


 Even with her mute acupuncture point pressed, she struggled with all her might to make a sound.


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard, watching her, spoke.


 “You’re persistent.”


 “Mmph!”


 “But don’t overdo it.”


 “Mmph!”


 “You came to retrieve your father’s severed hands? Your filial piety seems admirable, but it’s excessive.”


 “…”


 At his words, Song-ah, who had been putting in effort to make a sound, stopped and glared at the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard.


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard then picked up a leather pouch from the floor and held it up to Song-ah.


 He then pushed it towards her and said.


 “If you had made a reasonable commotion and left, it would have looked plausible, but why did you go to such lengths to retrieve this?”


 “…”


 “Strictly speaking, these aren’t even your master’s hands, are they?”


 At those words, Song-ah’s eyes trembled slightly.


 Seeing her somewhat subdued attitude, the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard released the mute acupuncture point that had been blocked.


 -Tatatatatak!


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard then said to Song-ah.


 “I’ve enclosed this space with true qi, blocking the sound between the inside and outside of the carriage. Shouting won’t do any good, so confess the truth.”


 At his words, Song-ah tightly shut her mouth.


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard shook his head and spoke.


 “I see. It would be troublesome for you to reveal the truth here. But you’ve already been caught.”


 “…What have you caught?”


 In response to her question, the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard set the leather pouch on the floor and replied.


 “These aren’t the real master’s hands, are they?”


 “What are you talking about? You severed my father’s hands and now claim they’re not the real master’s hands…”


 “For the hands of someone who creates human skin masks, the distribution of calluses seemed consistent.”


 “What does that mean?”


 “From what I know, the process of creating human skin masks is more difficult than one might think, and the craftsman’s hands are unlikely to remain intact due to the glue and various chemicals used. However, the owner of these hands is no different from someone who has only done slaughter work their entire life.”


 “…”


 At these words, Song-ah’s expression hardened even more.


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard, further convinced by her reaction, continued.


 “Perhaps the master whose hands were severed is a fake. I didn’t think you would easily expose the real craftsman to others.”


 Speechless at the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard’s piercing speculation, Song-ah, who had been keeping her mouth shut, finally swallowed her saliva and spoke.


 “No. That person is really…”


 “If I were to turn the carriage around right now, go back to Hong Bong Meat, and raid the place, would you confess the truth?”


 “…”


 -Grip!


 At his threat, which wasn’t really a threat, she bit her lip tightly.


 She wanted to deceive him, but he was not someone she could deceive.


 In the end, she confessed the truth.


 “…You’re right. That person is not the real master.”


 “Finally, we’re getting somewhere.”


 At those words, Song-ah snorted and spoke with a sneer.


 “Then, of course, you must have also figured out that I’m not his real daughter…”


 “Of course, you’re not his daughter, but you’re not a fake either.”


 “What?”


 “Your hands.”


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard pointed to her hands with a nod.


 The skin on her palms was peeled, and calluses were so prevalent that it was difficult to find a properly intact area.


 Because of this, the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard was convinced that she was the real craftsman’s daughter.


 ‘Damn it.’


 Realizing that she could no longer deceive him, Song-ah could only grit her teeth and glare at him, unable to do anything else.


 “So what are you going to do with me? Will you use me as a hostage to find the real one?”


 “Is that what you wish for?”


 “Then I’ll bite my tongue and die right here.”


 “Willing to give up your life for your father…”


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard pondered her words, then chuckled and spoke.


 “If I truly intended to use you as a hostage, do you think there would be a reason for us to have this conversation?”


 “…What do you mean by that?”


 She asked, puzzled.


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard lowered his voice cautiously, even though he had said he blocked the sound between the inside and outside of the carriage, and spoke.


Foll𝑜w current novℯls on ƒrēewebnoѵёl.cσm.

 “I had no choice but to sever the fake master’s wrists due to orders, but I wouldn’t have done so if he were the real one.”


 “What?”


 “I’m saying I had no intention of making an enemy of your father, the real craftsman.”


 At the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard’s words, she frowned.


 Was he testing her?


 She couldn’t adapt to his suddenly changed attitude.


 “Do you think I’ll believe your words?”


 “Of course, you won’t believe me. But I have my circumstances where I have no choice but to obey someone’s orders. Of course, I won’t ask you to understand this.”


 “…Even if you have such circumstances, I can’t trust you.”


 “I know. But if it were a lie, having this conversation would be meaningless, as I said before.”


 At these words, Song-ah became increasingly confused.


 Was this man’s true intention what he was showing now?


 To her, who couldn’t escape her doubts, the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard said.


 “I will release you soon


 “What? You’re releasing me?”


 “That’s right.”


 “Why?”


 “Didn’t I say I have no intention of making an enemy of you or your father, the craftsman?”


 “…”


 “I won’t force you to trust me. Once I release you, take your real father and leave Gaebong within four days. It may not be immediate, but if someone has a keen eye, they will eventually notice these hands. However, I will buy you time for four days.”


 “Why… why are you trying to help us?”


 Song-ah asked, not understanding his intention to show her goodwill.


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard replied in a low voice.


 “It’s not for nothing. I also need help.”


 “Help?”


 “Yes.”


 “Help, could it be…”


 “Bring me a human skin mask.”


 “A human skin mask?”


 “That’s right.”


 “What kind of…”


 “It’s simple. Just recreate the same human skin mask that was requested before.”


 At his request, Song-ah asked, puzzled.


 “Why are you asking me to make the human skin mask again?”


 “I have no obligation to tell you that. It’s a mutually beneficial condition, so just make the same human skin mask. Can you…”


 -Flinch!


 At that moment, the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard stopped mid-sentence.


 “What’s wrong?”


 “…The carriage has stopped.”


 He had blocked the sound between the inside and outside of the carriage with true qi, so he couldn’t hear the outside.


 But that didn’t mean he couldn’t feel the vibrations of the carriage.


 He hadn’t paid attention while conversing, but the carriage seemed to have been stopped for quite a while.


 Thus…


 -Swish!


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard released his true qi, opened the carriage door, and stepped outside.


 However…


 ‘!?’


 All the officials and four Embroidered Uniform Guards outside were lying unconscious.


 ‘When?’


 Although he had blocked the sound, it hadn’t been that long.


 Yet this had happened in such a short time?


 

  Sensing that something was amiss, the masked Embroidered Uniform Guard unhesitatingly tried to press the acupuncture points below his ears with his thumbs.


 But then, a voice came from behind him.


 “I was bored waiting. So, have you finished your secret conversation?”


 ‘An expert…’


 Even though he had sealed his qi points, the fact that someone had approached him from behind without any presence meant they were at least at the transcendent realm.


 The masked Embroidered Uniform Guard, who had his thumbs on the acupuncture points, spoke without losing his composure.


 “Who are you?”


 In response to his question, a completely irrelevant answer flowed from behind.


 “Which one would be better?”


 “What?”


 “Would it be better to have the Embroidered Uniform Guard’s Thousand-men Commander kill all his subordinates and officials and run away? Or would it be better to skin your faces and make use of them?”


 ‘!!!!!!’
