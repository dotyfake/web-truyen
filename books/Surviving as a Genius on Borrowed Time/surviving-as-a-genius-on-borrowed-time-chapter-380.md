[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/surviving-as-a-genius-on-borrowed-time-chapter-379/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/surviving-as-a-genius-on-borrowed-time-chapter-381/)◈ World (4)




It was a very unrealistic sight.


It was like a person rising from the shadows. It was a rare sight to see such things, even though the world was in chaos and all sorts of spirits, supernatural beings, and magical powers were causing chaos.


Sunmaryeonju was the most surprising.


‘Come back… …!’


The old man sent his thoughts towards the weasel.


Mayu. A spirit without a body and a mind.


The body was made of spirit, so it could come and go freely.


It was like a sword that could be used without much effort. It was even more so when the opponent was a master who had already mastered the art of fortune-telling.


As a pure spirit and a divine being, he should have returned straight to his master, but the old man’s grip was still empty. Only the cold wind swept past his skin.


There was a gulping sound. The white neck of the woman who had suddenly appeared shook for a moment.




ha-


A sigh of satisfaction wafted through the air. A reddish light shone from her one and only red eye. It was a look of satisfaction.


In the eyes of a pure-hearted person, it must have seemed like a bolt from the blue. The wrinkles on the sides of the old man’s eyes rose.


“This bastard dares… …!”


“What the heck…? That’s not something you should hear from an old man. I’ve been a direct descendant of the same line since birth, and an old man, um… … .”


Chilsado, who had been speaking in a whisper, trails off. He is mocking Sunmaryeon, a sect of the old Ming religion.


The words themselves are well-known facts, but they are difficult to say in front of the absolute being.


Kugu Palace―


Once again the sky became shadowed.


The shadows that came from the spreading magic were unusual in that they blocked out the sunlight.




At this moment, the sight of the whites of Sunmaryeonju’s eyes turning black was also bizarre.


At that time, Jeong Yeon-shin was looking at the back of Chil-sado’s long flowing hair.


He slowly moved his lips away.


“you.”


The shoulders of Chilsado, who was looking at Sunmaryeonju with a sad look, trembled slightly.


She didn’t look back.


It was complicated to figure out the reason.


Perhaps it was because they could guess how Jeong Yeon-shin felt about the death of the Dangga siblings, or because the gaze of Sunmaryeonju was overwhelmingly upon them, or because the elders of Ami and Cheongseong, who had been protecting Jeong Yeon-shin on both sides, turned to look at her.


“Amitabha.”


“Satae, it seems that the nobles of the Blood Flame Sect are after the Magwangikju. I will take charge of the Sunmaryeonju, and you, Satae, take care of that blood demon… … .”




Woohoo!


A pure energy wave began to flow out from the bodies of Baekyaksa and Cheongsu Jinin.


The dust on the ground spread out in a huge circle. In an instant, dust rose up in all directions.


Cheongsu Jinin’s reaction was like that of Baekdo Jeongpa.


It was different from the Baekyak incident where the existence of the Seven Sado was guessed before.


The thought of the death of the sword spread out like a sharp wave of energy, and it seemed as if it would cut down not the Pure Marryunju but the Seven Sado swords.


“Vampires, don’t act rashly.”


It was a warning from the Qing Dynasty’s Jangmunin. He spoke only to Sunmaryeonju without even looking back.


A place where everyone is watching.


Suddenly, Chil-sado let out a smooth smile.


“What a shame. I could have sunk my teeth into Magwangikju’s neck.”


Act as an enemy.


Jeong Yeon-shin’s eyebrows furrowed, and Baek Yak-sa-tae’s eyes lit up.


Cheongsu Jinin, as if it were nothing, shook off his sword and took a step towards Sunmaryeonju.


That was when.


A dull shockwave swept through the ground, and the new form of the Pure Marian Warriors disappeared from sight as if distorted.


At the same time, Chil-sado kicked the ground and lifted himself high into the air.


Hwaaaa …


[I was after you from the beginning!]


It was empty space.




The hem of Sunmaryeonju’s long robe fluttered violently in the strong wind pressure. The palm of his hand, thrust out in front of Chilsado, approached with great force.


Sunmaryeon Myungcheonmasinse (冥天摩神勢). It was literally about cultivating divinity.


The old man’s technique was incredibly fast. It cut through the space without a single gust of wind.


In that moment, Sunmaryeonju’s eyes widened.


The reason was that the indifferent face of the Demon King was reflected above the completely blackened eyes.


The energy that had grown from the outstretched palms was scratching the space translucently. The continuous explosions that occurred before they even collided were incredibly loud.


Return.


[… … !]


Sunmaryeonju hastily pulled his hands back. At the same time, he unleashed ten waves of energy from his two hands, creating a dark sphere in front of his body.


The atmosphere was compressed by the force of the blast. An enormous force surged inside the sphere.


A response worthy of a tax expert.


It was not magic, but pure power.


“A trick.”


The moment the silent Jeong Yeon-shin stretched out her hand, a ripple burst out from the point of impact, encompassing the entire peak.


Kwaaaa …

The space at the point of impact was distorted.


The air, mixed with white and black waves, repeatedly crumpled and rippled.


The moment the palm of Jeongyeonshin, which was filled with the power of the inner circle, grabbed the sphere without hesitation and burst it, several layers of spheres spread out translucently, centering around the three people who had been hovering in the air for a moment.


Kookookookook!!


It was when the entire peak beneath my feet shook.


The two new models were launched in opposite directions, at a frightening speed, as if the shock waves were all used as propulsion waves.


Sunmaryeonju and Chilsado. Some of the crowd, who were looking up with blank expressions, pointed their fingers.


“Run away… The Pure Marryunju is running away!”


“What is this… … !”


“One second notice! Magwangikju wins again!”


\* \* \*


Hogwang Yangyang. The nature of the emperor.


Antique desks were lined up long and narrow. The characteristic bronze luster of the sandalwood stood out on all sides.


This is the main building of the headquarters.


Originally, it was a space where dozens of writers could hold their brushes, but it had been a long time since they all moved to the central training ground.


Even the originally thick scent of ink became faint.


Swish.


Grand Chancellor Im Jin-myeong stroked his beard and then suddenly lowered his hand. It was a habit from his early days as a literary officer.


He unconsciously brushed his beard to boost his energy. This was something he rarely did after taking the position of head of the General Administration.


There is no other cause.




It is because of the old man who has pushed aside the owner and is sitting in the highest seat at this moment.


He was the head of the Iphwangseong Seonrowonju.


“I’ll tell them to bring out the dragon tea… … .”


“It worked.”


The elder brother cut off the Grand Master’s words.


The spirit that radiated from his aged body was amazing. He still had a large figure and wore a purple robe, but his wrinkled face, which was covered with a smile, was unusually cold, as if he had been covered with frost.


Although he was originally a person of high virtue with a kind attitude and easy-going demeanor.


He is not like an old man who has fallen after suffering misfortune at the hands of the Sword Master, the Blood Flame Sect Master, and the Supreme Master of the Tang Clan.


The Grand General opened his mouth cautiously.


“It’s been a long time since I last visited you, my lord, due to unforeseen circumstances. How have you been lately?”


“You’re practicing external martial arts. It seems to fit your body quite well.”


“I’m glad your behavior has improved that much.”


“Well, the pupil that was passed down from Magwangikju to Maga is so enviable. They say that the children who were impatient fell into a state of training… I was so curious about the knot that I couldn’t hold back. By the way, has Magwangikju’s marriage partner been decided?”


“I don’t know.”


“Then I guess there’s no one else to ask. At least for now.”


“… … .”


“Because it’s inherently empty. It’s so vain.”


The main topic has come up. The Grand General nodded slowly.


“Yes, this is my first time experiencing this too.”


“There is chaos in the Senate.”




“… I guess so. I guessed it.”


“This is an incident where the prestige of the original character falls to the same level as that of the gangsters of the martial arts world. Yongga’s decisiveness sometimes surpassed even the temper of old Maga, but it exploded in a place where it should not have exploded. I didn’t know that he would abandon the people’s livelihood.”


A dry voice. I could immediately feel that he was suppressing his anger.


The elder Wonju is a warrior who lived in the same era as the traitor Ma Yeon-jeok.


A person who could be called by the names of all the masters of the previous and current swordsmen without anyone saying anything. Even after losing his martial arts skills, his influence on the internal affairs of Iphwangseong was enormous.


‘There are few people as kind as this person under the sky.’


The Grand Master thought.


A summons issued to the 17th generation of the Shingumdan.


Gathering of the major shareholders.


This is the reason why the elder lord, who even greeted the White Knight with a smile, has an icy temperament.


The order to appoint a new leader was a huge event in itself, and opinions on it were sharply divided even within the clan.


“Promote peace? This is an act that shakes the banner of nature. It is not only the old men of the Senate who are furious. The old man is also holding back great anger. Those black men who have been waiting for this to happen, I think I should go and settle it right away… …!”


The elder stopped straightening his back.


A dull sound was heard from the lower back near the Myeongmun point. The old man frowned as if enduring the pain.


“Some old people are so blessed in their later years that they are living in high spirits… … .”


“If you are talking about Magwangikju, he is the Bokrak of Iphwangseong.”


“I won’t deny it.”


The elder replied.


“There is no need to talk about the value of the contemporary Magwangikju again now. I came here to discuss something else.”


“which……?”




“The next generation of Shingeomdanju.”


The old man spoke briefly. A slur came from the Grand Master’s mouth.


“I’ve thought about it, but the matter is too serious… … .”


“Yes. It’s a big deal, like the seventeen continents gathering in one place.”


“… … .”


“That Yongga guy has no choice but to step down from his position. That’s the position of the divine sword of Iphwangseong. He can even look down on the first-rank officials of the imperial family, and he can immediately decapitate any martial artist… But I can’t put my subordinates above the common people of this land. That guy has shaken the very essence of Iphwangseong.”


“Is this the Senate’s decision?”


“It’s not just the Senate. The Yullyeongdaeju Yunsoyu received the document of dismissal. There was no question about it. Isn’t it the same for you?”


The general did not answer.


If he were the head of the law, it would have been natural for him to do so. He is not the type of person to be lenient about mistakes just because he is superior.


The words of the elders are not excessive. The leader of the Shingeomdan at the time gave an extremely unreasonable order.


The power of the seventeen major lords of the time, united together, is difficult to measure even for a general. If not careful, the imperial family may view Ip Hwang-seong as an independent warlord and keep an eye on him.


One must be accountable before the Emperor.


The Emperor of the Holy Land cannot do this. She has been away with Mayenjeok for a long time. The one who gave the order, Shingeomdanju, had to take off his long robe.


then.


Who will inherit the symbol of the Shingeomdanju, the Ipsin Sword?


“It’s my business. I’d like to recommend a candidate.”


The elder statesman said.


The General Office, the New Sword Corps, and the Senate. These are the central figures that make up the Imperial Palace.


The Shingeomdan was away. The General Staff and the Senate had to carry out important business.




“The old man thought of three people. If we consider their accumulated achievements and experience, there is no one else.”


The elder held out a small piece of paper. There were three names written on it.


[Shin Geum Bu Dae Ju, Iphwang Shinchang Aksurim.


The Great Lord of Myeolseom, Lord Mokshin, Shin Hwang.


Yeoui Cheonju, Yongkwon Bukgung-ah.]


The paper gave off a clear, unique scent of mulberry. The Grand Master, who had been absentmindedly scribbling down the names of the three, opened his mouth.


“I expected it.”


“It’s true that the lack of wit is disappointing compared to the positions they have been assigned, but all three of them have infinite potential. They may be able to overcome the wall in a short period of time. At best, in ten years… … .”


“It’s a long time in troubled times.”


“There’s nothing we can do. The most urgent task is to fill the position and improve the people’s livelihood. The leader of the Shingeomdan who has lost the people’s support can no longer be called the leader of the Shingeomdan. That Yongga guy should just be a dark swordsman.”


“It’s been a long time since the whereabouts of the single person were known… … .”


“Don’t worry. He might be squirming somewhere, but he’s not the type to die. Back to the main topic… … .”


The elder, with a wrinkle on his forehead, continued speaking.


“Except for the Great Lord of Myeolseom, there isn’t a single person I really like. They are all light-hearted. I can clearly see them running off to Sacheon just by receiving the summons.”


“Well… … .”


“Those who call themselves the Master of the Ultimate Palace and the Master of the Dragon Squadron also have strange personalities.”


“The lord is not here. In this situation, the orders of the lord must be given the utmost priority, so the people of the original castle are not at fault. Can they not disobey orders?”


“If you allow me to ask, are the seventeen flags still preserved there?”


The elder pointed to a long table in the center of the room. The Grand Master was silent for a moment.


Iphwangseong is a breakwater close to the military.


There is a protocol.


When something important enough to put the name of the clan on public display occurs, the Seventeenth Division of the Shingumdan wears a flag with the name of each armed force engraved on it.


Recently, Myeolseomdae, Ma Gwang-ik, and Changcheondae used it to destroy the Hwangbo family.


“… I don’t think there’s any need to open it.”


“I knew it. You little bastards.”


“That means the big lords are looking down on the recent strong men. In order to protect the people, shouldn’t the original warriors be in good health?”


“How many did you take?”


The question from the senator was evidence of this.


The Senate of Iphwangseong. The place where Mayan Jeok once wanted to sit on the throne.


Now, they have completely lost control over the major shareholders. This is because the nature of the Ip Hwang Seong clan is close to the military, but it is essentially a gangster faction.


The fallen Elder Lord may have great influence on the major and minor affairs of Iphwangseong, but he cannot directly control the Seventeen Great Lords.


The Grand Chancellor thought absentmindedly. The Senate’s power has been weakened to an unprecedented degree, so their power to restrain the new leader of the Shingeomdan within the castle has also decreased.


In that case, people with self-righteous tendencies would not be good. For example, people like Aksurim, the Sword Master, or Bukgungah, the Lord of Yeoui Heaven.


Swish.


The Grand Master opened his mouth, picked up his brush, and began to write a name under the piece of paper the Lord Elder had handed him.


“The flag of the Shingumdan was taken by Iphwangsinchang Aksurim.”


“… Seventeen flags, all of them… … ?”


“He disappeared, holding her in his arms with his short arms.”


The moist brushstrokes traced the oily grease with one stroke.


When the elder suddenly lowered his gaze, several words referring to one person were lined up in black.


[Seomye, Hwajungamwang, Yeonhwanata.


[Magwangikju Jeongyeonshin.]
