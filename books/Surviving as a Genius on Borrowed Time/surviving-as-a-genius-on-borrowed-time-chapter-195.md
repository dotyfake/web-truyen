# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 195 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Cheonju Jin-in (Thiên Trụ Chân Nhân) nói với Yu-hyeon (Du Hiên) rằng anh đã quên một câu chuyện quan trọng liên quan đến Paegeomjongju (Bái Kiếm Tông Chủ) và việc môn phái Hwasan (Hoa Sơn) cần chuẩn bị cho sự trỗi dậy của hắn. Anh cũng nhắc nhở Yu-hyeon về việc điều hòa năng lượng Jasodan (Tử Hà Đan) trong cơ thể và chuẩn bị cho việc bế quan. Yu-hyeon có vẻ không hài lòng khi so sánh bản thân với Jeong Yeon-shin (Trịnh Diễn Thần). Cheonju Jin-in cũng đề cập đến việc gia tộc Tang (Đường) đến Hanjung (Hán Trung) muộn và tình hình hỗn loạn ở Tứ Xuyên sau khi các cao thủ Sunmaryeon (Tôn Ma Luyện) bị Seomye (Thư Mi) tiêu diệt. Đột nhiên, Cheonju Jin-in cảm nhận được sóng năng lượng mạnh mẽ của Magwangikju (Ma Quang Dực Chủ) và biết rằng có chuyện gì đó đã xảy ra.

Trong khi đó, Jeong Yeon-shin cùng Jegal Cheong-a (Gia Cát Thanh Nga) gấp rút đến Cheonghakru (Thanh Hạc Lâu) để ngăn chặn ba thế lực lớn tấn công Hwangbogaju (Hoàng Phủ Gia Chủ). Cậu nhận ra rằng nếu không nhanh chóng bảo vệ được thi thể Thanh Kỳ Lân, gia tộc Zhuge (Gia Cát) sẽ có cớ để tấn công. Yeon-shin biết mình đang phạm tội chống lại thế gia Menghui (Mạnh Hồi) và phải hành động trước khi mọi thứ trở nên tồi tệ hơn.

Khi đến gần mục tiêu, Yeon-shin và Cheong-a bị chặn lại bởi Hyeoncheondae (Hiền Thiên Đội) của gia tộc Zhuge, một đội quân tinh nhuệ cả nam lẫn nữ, nổi tiếng với Yunbaek Chamjeoljin (Vân Phách Trảm Tuyệt Trận), một loại trận pháp sử dụng nội năng để tăng cường sức mạnh và làm chậm đối thủ. Iphwangsinchang Aksurim (Nghịch Thương Ác Sư Lẫm) đã cảnh báo Yeon-shin về sự nguy hiểm của đội quân này và khuyên cậu nên phá hủy trận pháp trước khi giao chiến.

Yeon-shin sử dụng bộ pháp đặc biệt của mình, phá vỡ thế trận của Hyeoncheondae và tiến lên phía trước. Các thành viên Hyeoncheondae không hề nao núng, họ nhanh chóng điều chỉnh lại đội hình và tấn công Yeon-shin. Cậu nhận ra rằng mình không còn là một người vô danh nữa, mà là Magwangikju, một đối thủ mà mọi thế lực đều phải dè chừng.

Yeon-shin quyết định sử dụng toàn bộ sức mạnh của mình. Cậu kích hoạt Neungbeop Gwangryungi (Lăng Pháo Quang Luân Nghi) và tung ra một cú đấm mạnh mẽ, phá tan đội hình của Hyeoncheondae. Lãnh đạo đội Hyuncheon bị đánh bại.

Tuy nhiên, những thành viên còn lại của Hyuncheon vẫn tiếp tục tấn công với những đường kiếm hiểm hóc. Yeon-shin mở lòng bàn tay, sử dụng Mancheonhwawoo (Mãn Thiên Hoa Vũ), một kỹ thuật biến những mảnh vỡ của kiếm thành vũ khí, đánh bại hoàn toàn đối thủ. Yeon-shin thể hiện sức mạnh áp đảo của Magwangikju trước gia tộc Zhuge.

“This private tutor has grown old. He has forgotten an important story.”


Cheonju Jin-in looked down at Yu-hyeon and spoke. He had left Yunhyangwon where the envoys of Iphwangseong were staying.


The two people’s footsteps echoed softly on the yellow earth that was soaked with the autumn of the Chuseok holiday, and Sasukjil spoke softly.


“Ah… … You said you had other business with Yeonshin. You forgot? It wasn’t something that happened?”


Yu-Hyeon raises his head slightly and asks with his black eyebrows raised.


The strictness of the sword discipline was also well known within the main sect.


He never forgot what he had to do, and he tended to hold his disciples of the Hwasan faction to the same standards as his own conduct.


He is a noble swordsman only to those outside the sect. Within the main sect, he is a living King of Hell.


‘When I go back, I might be ordered to do closed-door training. Since you even shared the sword with Yeonshin.’


The corners of Yu-Hyeon’s mouth lowered weakly.




Sa-suk showed a particularly gentle attitude towards Jeong Yeon-shin, which was truly unusual.


As a swordsman, it was not easy to gain the favor of the swordsman. It was harder than finding an actual plum tree on the rocky peak of a barren volcano.


If the disciples of the lower-ranking main branch witness this, they may feel jealous.


Just as Yu Hyeon himself became the eldest son at a young age and was left out by his peers.


‘Isn’t there something like that? He’s worse than me, but he seems to be on good terms with his subordinates. It’s ridiculous that those subordinates are Baekgirin and Taeyeonryong.’


Sa-suk, who noticed Sa-jil’s strange behavior, stroked Yu-hyeon’s head once.


“Wasn’t the sharpening of the sword by the Demon King amazing?”


Cheonjujin thought of Seomye. A strange boy. He was not the white warrior who was under Majin’s protection in Seoan.


It was so eye-catching that I couldn’t even imagine what kind of chaos we had been through last time.


Should we be thankful that the mysterious qualities are at least in the possession of Ip Hwang-seong? If he had been born in Sima Weidao, he would have been a source of worry to the world.




Yu-Hyeon’s white face became puffy.


“I know how to make it double-edged, not single-edged. I’ve already mastered the first ten seconds of the Plum Blossom Sword Technique.”


“You can say that after seeing the sword of the Magwangikju? It is very difficult for you to handle such a powerful light wave. Ten years is enough.”


“Yeonshin lives several times faster than I do. I don’t know if it’s ten times faster. No, I don’t know. It gets in the way of my progress. It just makes me impatient.”


“Comparison creates evil spirits. If you silently accumulate enemy attacks, one day your sword will glow. That’s great. You have discovered the secret of the wall-mounted training. As you return, first take care of the Jasodan energy within your body. Prepare the wall-mounted training.”


“Private school?”


It was an old private affair. After exchanging a few more pointless words, the main topic came up.


Yu-Hyeon smoothed down the white crown that was on top of her head.


The reason why the symbol of the Taoist priest was blurred was because he was expressing his inferiority complex about his friend’s qualities in words.


“You were going to tell Yeonshin about the Paegeomjongju?”




“okay.”


Cheonju Jin-in gently stroked my side. Yu-hyeon, who was looking at me with shady eyes, opened his mouth.


“Is he going to hit Jongnam again? There is no such thing as the only child anymore… … .”


“The Cheongseong Jangmunin has passed away. I personally experienced it and realized that he had tempered his swordsmanship through providence. If it weren’t for the main mountain, it would have been my heart that was cut instead of the plum blossom swordsmanship. The Paegeomjongju has become a peerless swordsman who can do anything, so the main sect should also prepare for it. The Paegeomjong will rise again… and a fierce wind will blow in Shaanxi.”


The tone of the swordsman’s words was more serious than ever. Yu-Hyeon suddenly glanced back.


“He is Yeonshin’s enemy, so he should go back now… … .”


“It would be better to tell you later. A swordsman who is about to fight must sharpen his mind and body. I am afraid that the enemy’s words will dull the blade.”


“ah.”


Yu-Hyeon nodded as if he understood, but then stopped.


“They say that the sword of the Black Star can even split a mountain peak… … Well, I guess a black sword like the Ip Hwang Star will save face. There’s no way the leader would use his powers to kill.”


“The problem is my extremely low martial arts skills,” muttered the young Taoist monk, who suddenly raised his face.


“By the way, I heard that the Tang family has just arrived. Why did they arrive so late? After the Gaepa War ended… .”


“The Sacheon Province is also in disarray. The main masters of the Sunmaryeon were killed by Seomye, and the ten-member clan is said to be in critical condition. If the Tang clan wanted to conquer Sacheon, it would have been enough to overcome the True Dragon Clan… … Recently, the Clan was unified into a single clan called the Golden Wing Clan. The resistance must have been formidable. On the contrary, I don’t understand why the Tang clan leader came all the way to Hanjung in person.”


That was when.


The eyes of the Cheonju Jinin who had been telling the story sank.


“Yoo Hyeon-ah.”


“yes?”


“From afar, the waves of the Magwangikju’s energy spread like a raging wave. Something must have happened.”


\* \* \*


Jeong Yeon-sin went forward with Jegal Cheong-a.




There wasn’t much time.


It was said that the time when the three major officials left was less than half an hour. Jegal Qing’er didn’t even know where they were.


I only guessed that it might be the top of Cheonghakru in front of the Menghui main building.


It is said to be a place where high-ranking officials, including Eonhwaryeon, secretly enjoy themselves.


The imperial capital cannot support the three major states.


It was a clear and concise statement. It was a clear fact.


The three great lords who were staying at the edge of the black area joined forces to attack Hwangbogaju.


Just as he had defeated enemies with little difference in skill in a short battle, Jeongyeonshin could have suffered the same fate.


It was said that the masters of the purple neighborhood acted as absolute powerhouses anywhere in the world.


The Zhuge Liang and Murong Liang families, who were watching the Gaepa War due to their status and distribution, looked down on the boy.


It was natural, considering his age and position.


‘We have to capture it before they get there.’


The boy thought.


If we fail to secure the body of the Qing Qilin in time, it will be considered a preemptive strike against the Zhuge family under a false pretext.


It will definitely be a cornered place. Jeong Yeon-shin is now committing a crime against the Sega family that has been built in Menghui.

Even if the debt of the Zhuge family cuts off the head of the Ma Guangyi family, no one will say anything.


That was the way of the martial arts world.


After some martial artists who had been labeled as traitors managed to avoid extinction by using their elusive powers, the imperial family drew a line between themselves and the imperial family externally.


Because of the dignity of the Emperor, the enemies of the Emperor were no longer considered traitors.


In the end, the only thing left between Kangho and Iphwangseong was the difference in power. That’s why the Murim Alliance was formed.


Now that the alliance is formed.


When the heads of the eight families gathered together, it was time to discuss the imperial family.


Those with authority and power can do anything. This was not an ordinary situation.


That is why the leader of the Imperial Family sent in the new Ma Gwang-ik-ju, who had unprecedented qualities. In order to dampen the morale of the Murim Alliance in advance.


Now it was the end.


It’s a race against time.


Percussion!


Every time I hit the ground, dust rose up. Walls and pavilions passed by at a rapid pace.


While running, I had to keep an eye on everyone. Even as a one-time mission, it was an extremely difficult task.


Reason and anger were intertwined. Even though I had rational thoughts as the basis of my Jin-gi operation, I occasionally felt myself aging.


It felt like a sharp maple leaf had fallen on my head.


A clear ringing in the ears, a murderous gesture, anger in the waves, and a cold flash of the upper body that is colder than reason.


“The main gate… is an intruder… …!”


“The lady is with you!”


“A hostage?”




“Magwangikjuda! Deploy with extreme force!”


There were many men blocking the light charge. There were seven men in the front line, and there were also many men rushing in from behind.


He has a white crane tattooed on the left chest of his green uniform, but no one looks down on him.


Zhuge Liang’s Hyeoncheondae (賢天隊) is a military unit with an even mix of men and women. Each of them had extraordinary eyes.


He said that he specialized in martial arts. He was an elite of the Sega family.


Phew!


An artificial wind rose from their bodies. It was a typified air wave. It was like a cloud, and it touched my skin.


Anyone who saw it would be able to tell that a fierce battle had been waged. It must be the famous Yunbaek Chamjeoljin (雲魄斬絶陣).


It wasn’t the usual formation.


I heard that they do not use the organs or surrounding objects, but instead resonate the internal energy techniques they have learned in a certain direction to simultaneously increase their strength and slow down their opponents.


Iphwangsinchang Aksurim gave instructions to Jeongyeonshin before his departure.


―You know my internal energy, but you can still use that strange examination. Don’t go in right away and start by cutting down my energy. When I caused a ruckus at my parents’ house and got the blue badge, I almost crossed the Samdo River alone while showing off to those unlucky Jegal guys. Don’t do that to me. They’re so lethal. They treat joint attacks like shit.


It seemed like the senior who had changed his words and actions was chattering in my ear.


If it is a force with the same level as Sega’s face, it is no different from the force under the Shingeomdan.


It was a tremendous force. Anyone would agree that it could hold back the black master’s ankles even for a moment.


That won’t do.


‘fast.’


The concept of cutting down an opponent’s morale is a very vague one. The means are rare. However, Jeong Yeon-shin had a suitable method.


Wow!


A black gust of wind wrapped around the hem of the black military uniform pants. The halo that ran down to the veins of the legs scattered into light from the central point on the side of the calf.




It was only for a moment before the three blood vessels in the peach bones of the feet were covered with invisible armor.


The gait that was born from the cup of Iphwangseongju has become trembling.


‘It’s a good deal.’


thud!


It is a step that breaks through the momentum and creates harmony. A wave of energy spreads around the stepping foot.


Colorless waves push through the air. It was a moment.


The seven drones reached the air waves they were spewing out thickly, and then spun around in all directions as if they were spinning in reverse.


The principles of the formation are mysterious. It was the law that the resonance that was combined on each axis produced functions.


The convenience of Jinsik, like the Unbaek Chamjeoljin of the Hyeoncheon-dae masters, was added. In an instant, the strength was lost.


The pine needles floating above their heads began to fall like fluff.


It was ten paces away from Magwangikju.


“… … !”


Jegal Se-gae and Hyeoncheon-dae. Each of them wiggles their eyebrows or opens their mouths slightly, but they do not stop rushing.


Could it be Sega’s power? As a soloist, he had great spirit. He ran like a neatly-polished wind.


The dust that rises with every step is transparent. It was a refined nerve.


The same was true of skill. It seemed as if the axis of the formation would be readjusted at any moment. The pine needles scattered and rose in the energy wave that rose again between them.


It would be best if it was recovered just before colliding with Jeongyeonshin, but even if not, the determination was to do everything in his power to defend the area.


Your path may become entangled with colleagues rushing in from behind.


are you okay.


The boy thought.




What’s truly scary is the return of the Zhuge Liang family.


The small force that secretly followed from Iphwangseong to check on the safety of the youngest lord did not even come forward when Jeong Yeon-shin faced Sim Mu-ryeon’s forces.


However, it was different in front of Segajugeup.


If we’re not careful, it could easily escalate into a war of attrition, regardless of its original intention. We need to end it before things get messy.


‘New law, new wind god.’


grasp!


I violently tightened the extensor pollicis longus muscle from the tip of my toes to the bottom of my calf.


The fine muscles of my entire body contracted and expanded repeatedly. Fallen leaves swirled beneath my feet.


The moment the strong wind caressed their eyelids, the faces of the Hyuncheon-dae soldiers suddenly widened. They were approaching quickly.


Before the Yunbaek Chamjeoljin could be restored, the sound of Jegal Qing’er falling behind was heard along with the onlookers.


“Sword out!”


The leader of the Hyuncheon University team shouted with determination.


Even though she could not yet control the shock that was on her slender face, she extended her sword with a graceful leap.


The legs stretched back form a line with the sword. Using my body as an arrow, I forged a single line of sword strikes. It was a posture of deep-practiced divine sword unity.


Papapak!


The enemy lines spread out to the left and right were closing in like the flapping of a phoenix’s wings.


Even without any formation, they attacked at extraordinary intervals. The pine needles and maple leaves split apart in the narrow sword strikes of their extended swords.


The rustling of leaves made the air eerie.


Don’t let your guard down. This is the strike of a lifetime.


In the feeling of the upper body accelerating like a ray of light.




The boy realized something new.


Now his name is known all over the world.


He is neither a latecomer who gained fame in Namjikrye Cheongyagok nor a rising star who is only known as a king in the closed-off Sacheonseong.


We have entered the realm of the full-fledged martial arts world in the land of Korea and China.


He is a master who is being watched by the world today.


The sword forests and sword mountains of the world will no longer see boys as boys. As much as they treat the masters well, even the underlings risk their lives.


Those who are strong enough to discuss black would have prepared their ultimate attack from the beginning. With the victory in the Gaepa War, they could no longer hope for luck.


If you don’t fight with all your might against Dosan Geomrim, who is hell-bent on killing Magwangikju, you will die like all the enemies Jeongyeonshin has faced so far.


The sword of the master of Hyuncheon-dae that had come rushing in front of me was saying so. I could feel the texture of it cutting through the air on my skin.


‘Poetry and the Infinite Challenge.’


The boy implanted the light wheel into the Cheonjong point on his right scapula, while contracting his brachialis muscle.


It was a moment when the subtle movements of the muscles and veins amplified the power of the internal energy. The explosion of energy occurred violently.


Behind her back, the Neungbeop Gwangryungi exploded like a wall bomb. Jeongyeonshin’s right fist tore through the air.


He swept in from the side with a sharp, piercing sound that swept up his ears.


Jaycho, Jinbyeok.


Oh my god!


The sword surged forward, swallowing up even the resilience. The fragments of the shattered sword mixed into the whirlwind.


The sunlight reflected in all directions on the iron bars and swept over the face of the Hyeoncheon-dae master.


She, who had been in the air, fell down in a twisted trajectory like a leaf.


He gasped for breath as if his sternum had been crushed by a direct hit from the sword. He could not withstand the aftermath of the wall.


The boy didn’t rest even after hearing the new sound. The combined sword strikes that pierced through each breath were rushing in. Three on the left and three on the right.


It’s a movement specialized for hunting high-level martial artists. It’s too late to move your body.


There was no sign of triumph on their faces. Their expressions were indifferent as they came close and brandished their swords.


At first glance, it seemed as if they were doing everything they could to ensure that there were no gaps in the investigation.


The boy released the fist he had raised in a fist strike. The moment he opened his five fingers, the fragments of the sword that were falling while scattering light stopped in their tracks.


The straight acupoints of the palm, the small bow, and the middle bow became hot in an instant. The absorption and release were in perfect balance.


‘If Kang-ho treats me as a true Magwangikju, I will also act as a noble Magwangikju.’


Mancheonhwawoo.


It was a place where Jegal Se-ga and Ma Gwang-ik-ju clashed without retreating. Seomye’s footsteps were accompanied by splendid beams of light, just like her name.
