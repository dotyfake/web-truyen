# Absolute Regression Chapter 154 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Sau khi nghe Seo Dae-ryong lo lắng về Giải đấu Tiểu Long (Little Dragon Tournament), một cuộc thi võ thuật do Liên Minh Võ Lâm (Murim Alliance) tổ chức, nhân vật chính quyết định ép cậu ta tham gia. Anh ta trấn an Dae-ryong rằng đây là cơ hội tốt và không ai nhận ra cậu ta với bộ râu hiện tại. Anh ta còn "dụ dỗ" bằng cách nhắc đến những hậu quả nếu Dae-ryong từ chối, như việc bị anh trai chiếm quyền thừa kế và bị ám sát.

Cuối cùng, Dae-ryong đồng ý tham gia với vai trò là một bài kiểm tra cho người kế vị. Nhân vật chính tiết lộ mục tiêu thực sự là bắt giữ Cheonmyeonghoeju, kẻ có âm mưu lợi dụng giải đấu. Anh ta đưa cho Dae-ryong một thân phận mới để học thuộc và hứa sẽ làm người hầu cận, vệ sĩ cho cậu ta. Dae-ryong vui mừng ra mặt vì điều này.

Ngày hôm sau, họ đến Liên Minh Võ Lâm để đăng ký. Trong khi chờ đợi, họ nghe được thông tin rằng tám người lọt vào vòng chung kết sẽ được chọn vào tổ chức tinh nhuệ của Liên Minh. Sau khi đăng ký dưới cái tên Xu Long (Từ Long) đến từ phái Xu Dao (Từ Đạo) ở Gansu, nhân vật chính và Dae-ryong rời đi. Dae-ryong thể hiện quyết tâm chiến thắng và bắt đầu luyện tập chăm chỉ trên núi.

Trong khi đó, nhân vật chính cũng luyện tập cật lực và cuối cùng đã hoàn thiện việc bổ sung Thần Điện Gió (Wind God Temple) vào bố cục của mình. Anh ta cảm thấy vui mừng hơn cả khi đạt được Thập Nhị Đại Tinh của Bích Huyết Kiếm Pháp (Twelve Great Stars of the Bicheon Sword Technique).

Ngày thi đấu đến gần, lịch thi đấu được công bố. Trận đấu đầu tiên của Dae-ryong là trận thứ mười ba của giải Hwangjajo, diễn ra vào ngày mai. Trong khi ăn tối, Jeomsoi thông báo có một khách nữ muốn ngồi cùng bàn. Người phụ nữ đó không ai khác chính là Tần Tiểu Lăng (Qin Xia Ling), cháu gái của lãnh đạo võ lâm, người nổi tiếng xinh đẹp và tài giỏi.

**NOTICE: Many of the novels have been removed because they might cause violations, which we were not aware of earlier.**




[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-153/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-155/)Since the 154th time, I’ve only won first place.




“What’s going on?”


Seo Dae-ryong was still completely unaware of what was to come.


“You have to go to the Little Dragon Tournament.”


At the mention of the Little Dragon Story, Seo Dae-ryong was startled. Seo Dae-ryong was so surprised that he felt sorry for me and asked in a trembling voice.


“Surely the Xiaolong Temple you mentioned isn’t the Xiaolong Temple I know?”


“What is the Little Dragon Story that you know?”


“It’s a martial arts competition held by the Murim Alliance for the later generations of the orthodox faction. Since so many of the orthodox faction’s masters gather here, it’s an extremely dangerous martial arts competition that people from the Sapa or the main school are not allowed to participate in, let alone watch. Right?”


“Does that seem like the right competition?”


Seo Dae-ryong, who had been quietly staring at me, suddenly got up from his seat and went out of the guest house without looking back.


I didn’t bother to grab it and ordered some light snacks and drinks from Jeomso-i. I’ve been so absorbed in my training in the mountains that it’s been ten million years since I last had a drink.




After drinking a couple of glasses of alcohol, Seo Dae-ryong returned to his seat.


“Aren’t you going to catch it?”


“Why are you holding me back? I’ll be back.”


Seo Dae-ryong poured himself some alcohol and drank it in gulps.


“No, no. No, what are you talking about?”


“There is no one but you.”


“It’s the kind of thing that evil leaders use when they’re ordering their subordinates around. What’s the only thing you can do? If you look for it, there are many! If you look hard, there’ll probably be some in this guesthouse too.”


Seo Dae-ryong thought about the people around me that he would send away in his place, and soon sighed, saying that there were only strange people around me.


“That still won’t work.”


Seo Dae-ryong emptied his glass again.




“Do you know who I am?”


“I know. He has a ruthless personality that is power-oriented, but he is a man who only loves one woman, and when everyone else is silent… … .”


“Stop it!”


I omitted everything and added only the new additions.


“… … He is still a coward who was unable to confront Yeo-bin, but he is still my right-hand man, Detective Seo. Now, the story of him bravely participating in the Little Dragon War will also be added.”


“No, but even so, how can I go to the Little Dragon Hall?”


“But that doesn’t mean I can go out?”


“No one will recognize you. You look amazing now with your beard!”


“You say it’s a sewer disguise? You say it’s a dirty beard?”


He sighed and found a way out again. Seo Dae-ryong lowered his voice and whispered.




“I haven’t properly learned the martial arts from my master yet.”


“That’s better. Because you don’t want to show off. You have to fight with only the basics anyway.”


By the time he reached Seodaeryong, he would have already learned how to hide his magic, so there was no need for him to show off his martial arts skills.


I used my sword to resist the resistance of Seodaeryong, who lowered his head and radiated dark energy.


“Yes, if you don’t succeed, there’s nothing I can do. You will inevitably fail the test given by your father. In the end, your brother will become the successor. I will probably be assassinated and left in an unknown field to be eaten by wild beasts. Oh! But I won’t blame you. I’m serious.”


“I’ll probably die on the stage, stabbed by a sword from a sect I’ve never seen before. Then my body will go to the fake sect of the main school that provided me with a fake identity. Who is this guy? I don’t know. He must have been used and died. He’s short and gloomy. I feel bad for him. Hurry up and bury him. Ah! But I won’t blame you, Lord. Seriously.”


“Someday, when I become a cult leader, I will reminisce about today. Ah, if it weren’t for you, I wouldn’t have been able to become a cult leader. Thank you.”


“One day, I will sit my grandchildren on my lap and reminisce about today. Then, I will tell them that you are here because I pushed you to the end and you didn’t go to that competition.”


It was a battle between spears and shields. However, no matter how much you resisted, the outcome of this battle was already decided.


“Oh my, I really can’t live like this, I can’t live like this. Well, who can I blame for this? When you first came to Hwangcheon Pavilion, I was the one who wanted revenge on my senior, and I was the one who decided to learn Taoism.”


I poured some alcohol into his glass.


“thanks.”


“You know what I mean. Life is about doing things you don’t like.”


“People who say things like that, don’t they just live their lives doing what they want?”


“No! That’s what I should be saying!”


I know it’s a really big decision, because he’s the one who hates standing out the most.


“It will be a good experience for you as a warrior. Just looking at the names, it’s fate, right? Soryongjeon and Seodaeryong. In Soryongjeon, Daeryong ascends. If the name of the competition was Sohojeon, I would have called Jangho.”


In the end, Seo Dae-ryong ended up laughing at my pointless joke.


“Then this is a test for the successor.”


“yes.”




“What exactly should we do?”


“There’s a guy named Cheonmyeonghoeju. He’s planning to use this competition to plot something. He might be able to approach the participants, so that’s why you’re participating. Our goal is to catch him.”


“We have to catch them. It’s our job to catch bad guys.”


“He is my right-hand man.”


Once he made a decision, Seo Dae-ryong didn’t look back. Perhaps it’s because of his personality. That’s why I like Seo Dae-ryong. Behind that small, gloomy-looking appearance, there is an unwavering determination.


I took the documents out of my bosom and handed them over.


“Okay, here’s your new identity. Memorize it all, without leaving anything out. I’m good at memorizing things, so you don’t have to worry.”


“What about you, sir?”


“I will be your servant and bodyguard.”


Then, joy crossed Seo Dae-ryong’s expression. He tried hard to suppress the corners of his mouth from rising.


“Why do you like it?”


“Me? How could that be?”


“I just laughed.”


“You saw it wrong.”


“I laughed.”

“Oh, you punk. Why are you acting like a fool when you’re not an elder? Oh, I tried practicing once.”


I laughed happily at Seo Dae-ryong’s prank.


“Let’s memorize that for today and go apply for the Little Dragon Fight tomorrow.”


We got a large room with two beds.


As soon as I entered the room, Seo Dae-ryong stopped me from dusting my bedding.


“Don’t worry about me. Just think about you.”


“Is that okay?”


“I’m about to give you an order that could change your life, and you can do that. You can even pee in my bed.”


“It’s my life to receive that order. Don’t think of it as something bad. I, who actually received it, never thought of it that way. Especially after meeting you, Lord.”


Yeah, thanks for saying that.


Seo Dae-ryong, who had just unpacked and sat by the window, looked out at the scenery outside and spoke with concern.


“I need to climb as high as possible to find out what that Cheonmyeonghoeju guy is up to. I’m worried I’ll be eliminated too early.”


I also couldn’t predict the outcome because I didn’t know exactly what the level of the Little Dragon would be.


“Don’t worry. Elder Toma has left a plan for you.”


“Huh? What do you mean?”


I took a small pouch out of my bosom.


“This is the bag of tricks I gave you to take out when you reach your limit.”


Seo Dae-ryong was surprised. He was even more surprised than when I told him that he had to go to the Little Dragon Hall.


“You really gave this to me, Master?”


Actually, I was surprised too. I really didn’t think that Hyeolcheon Doma would give me something like this.




“Did you see what it said?”


“No. Why? Should I open it first?”


“Absolutely not! If the Master tells you to open it during a crisis, then you should open it during a crisis!”


Although he was curious about the contents inside, Seo Dae-ryong was deeply moved by the fact that Blood Heavenly Demon had given this to him. He really felt like looking out the window and bowing to Blood Heavenly Demon who was far away.


That day, Seo Dae-ryong couldn’t sleep until late at night because of various thoughts.


\* \* \*


The next morning, we packed breakfast and headed to the Murim Alliance.


In the distance, the magnificent building of the headquarters of the Murim Alliance began to appear. A huge unmanned stone statue modeled after a swordsman was visible.


As the Murim Alliance got closer, I began to feel strange. Later, the Murim Alliance was also swept away by the Hwamugi.


Will their fates change because I have returned? Or will only the fate of our school change? I still don’t know.


Seo Dae-ryong glanced at the passing female warriors.


“Aren’t the women of the political party pretty?”


“That’s true. I thought it was just a rumor.”


“While you’re here, try dating a woman. The fateful love between a Jeongpa Yeohaep and Mine!”


“It must be fun for the onlookers. How hard must it be for the people involved?”


Despite those words, Seo Dae-ryong’s gaze kept turning to the women passing by.


The place to apply for this Little Dragon War was set up separately in the Murim Alliance side story.


The line was long even though support was received over a period of almost five days. This was because numerous political faction supporters flocked from all over Central Plains.


We also stood in line at the application site.


While waiting like that, the people in the front row started talking about this competition.




To summarize their conversation, they were saying that they would not only select the winner, but also select all of the final eight members and place them in the elite organization of the Murim Alliance.


One of the people we were talking to smiled at Seo Dae-ryong and me. It seemed like he was ignoring us because we looked like we had just come up from the countryside.


I asked Seo Dae-ryong to listen to him.


“Your Majesty, are you confident that you will win?”


There was a strong protest in Seo Dae-ryong’s eyes, saying, ‘Winning? Suddenly?’, but his answer was strong.


“I have confidence.”


The guys in front exchanged glances and laughed at each other. But they didn’t openly pick a fight or ignore me.


After waiting for a long time, it was our turn.


“Name, Xu Long. The school is the Xu Dao School of Gansu.”


It is actually a sect in Gansu. It was directly operated by Tongcheon Pavilion in preparation for such incidents. If you go and investigate, you will find that his son, Xu Long, is there and that he left to participate in the Xiao Long War.


“The match schedule will be posted in front of the Murim Alliance in ten days. Please check the date and the stage then. If you are late for the match, you will definitely be disqualified, so go early and wait.”


“All right.”


After completing the application like that, I left the Murim Alliance.


“Did you see them ignoring me earlier? Now that we’re on the subject, I think I’ll just win.”


“There’s no way I can’t do it.”


“Can I really do this? I’ve been living my life like this ever since I was little, always trying to be number one. Don’t ignore me!”


“I won’t ignore you. Go ahead. You can win.”


“I really do!”


From that day on, Seo Dae-ryong went back and forth in the mountains to train until the competition began. I didn’t help him. He was learning from Blood Heavenly Doma, and it was something I shouldn’t have interfered with. I just believed in Doma’s teachings.


When Seo Dae-ryong went out to practice, I also practiced. Of course, I went to a different place to practice so as not to interfere with his practice.




Even before Seo Dae-ryong came, I had been practicing really hard in the mountains, but this time I practiced even harder. And this practice gave me the best results.


“I did it!”


Finally, the Wind God Temple has been added to the composition.


Honestly, I was happier than when I achieved the Twelve Great Stars of the Bicheon Sword Technique.


Now my flash beam can escape more dangerous moments more quickly, my shadow beam can avoid people’s eyes like an illusion, and my Hades beam can definitely be said to be extremely lethal in the face of power.


And the speedboat became frighteningly fast. The internal energy consumption was reduced, but the psychic energy consumption doubled. It was too fast. At first, it even crashed into a tree. If it wasn’t for the divine eye technique, it was a speed that couldn’t be handled even on a wide plain.


When I become accustomed to this configuration, the last remaining hurdle, the Fengshensabo, will tell me this.


-Are you sure you can finish it? With this kind of composition, what if you succeed? Okay, let’s try a little harder!


You must listen to me. Then, after you achieve great success, you will be able to tell this to the Wind God.


-You’ve had a hard time too!


I will definitely say this one thing.


After that, he will receive the teachings of the Nine-Handed Demonic Cultivation and become a great sage.


Even after achieving great success in both martial arts, I will continue to work hard without resting.


If you still can’t handle the firearm even after doing this… … I guess there’s nothing I can do about it. Then I’ll gladly die with a smile.


\* \* \*


The bracket has been announced.


The first match was the thirteenth match of the Hwangjajo tournament that was to be held tomorrow. It was said that because so many people were gathered, it would be held simultaneously in dozens of places outside the Murim Alliance.


“If our school held the same competition, would people gather like this?”


“He won’t come, right?”


“This is the power of the party. First of all, the numbers will be ten times greater.”




And they are not the only ones? The number of masters in hiding is also much higher among the masters of the Jeongpa faction.


This is why we shouldn’t start a war right now just because we’re stronger than the Murim Alliance. Even if we push forward and push all the way to the headquarters of the Murim Alliance, the real war will start from that day.


While I was eating with Seodaeryong and chatting about this and that, Jeomsoi came over to us in a hurry.


“Excuse me, but please join us. We are seeing a lot of customers because of the Little Dragon Hall.”


“Okay then.”


“thank you.”


Soon after, a woman wearing a bamboo hat joined us.


The moment she sat down and took off her hat, I was startled. It was someone I knew.


She is someone who is unlikely to ever share a table with anyone in her entire life, but she is called the most beautiful woman in Hubei with her cold and intelligent beauty, and she also has outstanding martial arts skills. Surprisingly, she is none other than Qin Xia Ling, the granddaughter of the leader of the martial arts world.
