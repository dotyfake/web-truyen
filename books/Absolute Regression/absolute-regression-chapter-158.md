Jin Pae-cheon lo ngại về sự nguy hiểm của thế giới võ lâm và muốn cô kết hôn với một người đáng tin cậy. Ha-ryeong đáp trả rằng những gì người ngoài thấy về cô không đúng sự thật, và cô sẽ kết hôn với bất kỳ ai, thậm chí một người hầu trên đường phố, để tránh cuộc hôn nhân sắp đặt. Ông của cô thách thức cô làm điều đó, tin rằng cô sẽ không bao giờ hạ mình đến vậy. Ha-ryeong bày tỏ sự tôn trọng với ông mình nhưng không muốn ông ép buộc mình.

Ha-ryeong thú nhận cô hay uống nhiều khi tức giận. Cô hỏi anh có sẵn lòng để cô lợi dụng trong một ngày không, và anh đồng ý. Cô mời anh đến dự tiệc của Võ Lâm Minh (Murim Alliance) vào ngày mai để gặp ông nội cô, nhưng anh từ chối vì điều đó hơi khó khăn.

Đúng lúc đó, một thanh niên bước tới. Đó là Jo Shin của Chân Long Trang (Jinryongjang). Anh ta khen ngợi vẻ đẹp của Ha-ryeong và tự giới thiệu mình.

Anh biết Jo Shin là một kẻ ngụy quân tử, che giấu bản chất tàn nhẫn của mình. Nhân vật chính lo lắng cho sự an toàn của Ha-ryeong và tự hỏi liệu số phận của cô có liên quan đến Jo Shin thay vì Thiên Ma Minh (Cheonmyeonghoe).

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-157/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-159/)Episode 158: Even if it’s just a servant walking along the road.




Jin Ha-ryeong was climbing the ladder.


Today is the day of her first match in the main competition. The cheers of the warlords were great. They respected and liked the leader of the martial arts world, so everyone liked his granddaughter, Jin Ha-ryeong. In addition, she was a beauty who was called the best beauty in Hubei, so it was natural that she was popular.


“You must win!”


“Jinharyeong is the best!”


“You’re pretty, Jin Ha-ryeong!”


“Buy me noodles!”


“The winner is Jin Ha-ryeong!”


Jin Ha-ryeong flinched on the stage.


Among the cheering, something that shouldn’t have been said was heard.


She looked around. She had never been on stage before and looked at the heroes, so cheers erupted from all directions. Among these many people, she found the person she was looking for. Sitting among the heroes, Geommu-geuk shouted.




“He just left again!”


Even amidst the cheers of the people, his words flew clearly and pierced her ears. At that moment, she realized that she had left without paying the bill again that day.


I even asked you to calculate it for me, but you didn’t do it again.


‘Oh! I can’t believe I’m this crazy!’


That day too, I got mad at that guy and just left.


Let’s say that’s true. So? You came all the way to Unarmed and yelled at me to buy you noodles?


It was so absurd that I burst out laughing.


The opponent who saw that sight hardened his impression. He misunderstood that she was making fun of him and laughing at him.


The misunderstanding only strengthened his will to win, but unfortunately, it did not narrow the gap in skill between him and her. Even her, who kept thinking of noodles throughout the fight.


As she was coming down the stage to the applause, she glanced at the place where the sword dance had been. However, the sword dance that had been there was no longer there.




You left without even watching the end of the show. You idiot! Did you really come here to collect money for noodles?


At that time, Chuho, the escort, came and reported.


“The lord has come to your residence.”


“Grandpa?”


Half an hour later, Jin Ha-ryeong entered the residence of the Murim Alliance Leader after passing countless strict guards.


Deep inside the Moorim Alliance, there was a place where beautifully carved rocks and thousand-year-old trees were elegantly combined, and it was like a place where immortals played. There, a man was sitting with his back to his chest, lost in thought. He looked like a part of a painting, blending in with the beautiful background.


“Grandpa, I’m here!”


“Are you here?”


A man of sturdy build turned towards her.


He looked twenty years younger than his age and had a perfectly muscular body that even young people lacked.




His body was one thing, but what dominated his impression were his eyes. His two large, intense eyes, which made even a tiger urinate when stared at, made him look like a kidney descended from the sky.


Aside from a place like this where the gods reside, there is someone who would be better suited to the stage where she was just now.


Jin Pae-cheon, the leader of the martial arts world.


He was the best master of the Jeongpa martial arts world and was the pillar of the Jeongpa martial arts world and was respected by everyone. There was even a saying that the reason the Demonic Cult could not act recklessly was because Jinpaecheon was alive and well, so he was the symbol of the Jeongpa martial arts world.


Even Jin Ha-ryeong thought his grandfather was a cool guy.


He was a man of good heart, strong will, and above all, a man of high chivalry. He was a man who deserved to be respected by everyone.


However, that was the evaluation of the unmanned Jin Ha-ryeong, and his granddaughter Jin Ha-ryeong’s evaluation was different. He was an old-fashioned and stuffy grandfather who suppressed her, nothing more, nothing less.


Honestly, that makes me even angrier. It’s because I think that while I’m so good and perfect to others, I’m actually worse to my family. I’m actually worse to the people I should be better to, and I’m sacrificing myself for people I never knew.


“I met the True Dragon Master a while ago.”


Today was the day we won the match, but the grandfather started talking about something else.


What’s the big rush? Let’s start with the story of my granddaughter’s victory in the Bimu. Or at least let’s talk about the weather today.


Of course, she couldn’t bring up such complaints. Her grandfather wasn’t scary, but he wasn’t comfortable either.


“How are you, Master Jang?”


“Even though he joked about having no energy, the old man was still very stubborn.”


This is a story about someone you would never think of in your entire life unless you were my grandfather.


But there was another reason why my grandfather brought up the topic of Jinryongjangju.


“I heard that my grandson who went to train in martial arts came back. He was subtly suggesting that I pair you up. What do you think?”


Ah! Here we go again.


“Why is our grandfather so anxious about marrying off his cute granddaughter? He doesn’t need a daughter-in-law from a prestigious family, does he?”


Even though she acted cute, Jinpaechun didn’t accept it.




“I’m asking for your opinion.”


“No, Grandpa, no, no.”


Jinpaecheon’s expression slightly frowned at her firm answer.


“Why don’t you like it?”


“Grandpa, would you want to marry someone you don’t even know?”


“He is a trustworthy person.”


“Who? You didn’t see Grandpa either?”


“You will know when you see the Jinryongjangju.”


“How on earth? Look at me, the granddaughter of a grandfather who is respected by everyone in the world. Am I the same as what people outside see? Noble, proud, and polite. No? I rebel like this. But how can you know the grandson just by looking at the Jinlongjangju?”


Jin Pae-cheon’s expression hardened, but Jin Ha-ryeong did not back down.


“As I said before, when the time comes, I will meet someone I like and get married.”


“That’s nonsense! Do you have any idea how dangerous this martial arts world is? It’s a place where all sorts of strange and bizarre people roam.”


The word strange suddenly reminded me of the arrogant servant. That’s true, that’s true.


“Jinryongjang is a place that has produced excellent warriors for generations, so it is a place you can trust.”


“That belief is only valid for my grandfather.”

“What do you mean?”


“No one would dare betray my grandfather’s trust. That’s why my grandfather’s judgment of people has always been so accurate. But I’m different. Just as people treat me differently from how they treat my grandfather.”


It was an irreverent word. The air around them became cold because of the aura of my grandfather’s anger.


But Jin Ha-ryeong did not back down. If he gave in to this anger, he might have to enter into a marriage he really did not want to enter into.


“If you keep pressuring me like this, I’ll marry anyone.”


“Anyone? Who on earth do you want to do it with?”


“Anyone on the street. Even if he’s a servant, it doesn’t matter.”


Even though she said it without thinking, she was inwardly startled. A servant?


“If you can do it, do it.”


“grandfather!”


“You can never do that. Don’t I know you? You can’t do that because of your pride. Go and bring someone, whether a servant or a street vendor. I’ll hold a grand wedding for you.”


Jin Ha-ryeong couldn’t deny it. That was his original self.


“I know best that my grandfather is a truly great man. I also know that he is a noble man who would gladly give up his life for the martial arts world. I also respect my grandfather the most. However, I don’t want to turn such a great grandfather into a cool martial arts leader who forces his granddaughter to marry him because of me.”


She knows why her grandfather is so actively involved in her marriage. It’s because of her late father.


Because I think my father died because he married the wrong person. He met the wrong woman and ruined his life.


My father was caught up in the favor of my mother’s family and eventually died in an ambush by enemies. My mother also died at the same time.


After all the revenge was over, the grandfather still had resentment in his heart.


Grandpa, how could that be because of Mom? It was the life Dad chose. Dad loved Mom until the moment he passed away.


That’s why I hated it even more, because I knew that my grandfather was going to send me to the family he had chosen.


“You don’t know the world yet. You don’t know how harsh and dangerous this martial arts world is.”




“I will learn it myself.”


“You’ll regret it later.”


“You will regret it.”


However, no matter how stubborn he was, it didn’t work on Jinpaecheon. Although he was known to be generous and open-minded, his heart did not apply to his granddaughter’s marriage.


“The grandson of the Jinryongjangju will be coming to dinner tomorrow night. Be sure to attend.”


Suddenly, he remembered what Geomyeon had said to him. Was that consideration for himself or for the other person? Could it be that his grandfather was making the same mistake?


“Is it for my own good that you want to marry me? Or is it to make Grandfather feel better?”


His grandfather was not as flustered as he was. Jin Paechun answered without hesitation.


“Both.”


Jin Ha-ryeong retreated for the time being due to Jin Pae-cheon’s determination to never back down.


“See you tomorrow.”


I understand how you feel, Grandpa, but it’s definitely not for me.


\* \* \*


“Hoo, hoo.”


Seo Dae-ryong, catching his breath after training, was definitely a different person than before.


When he was learning from Blood Heavenly Demon, he trained diligently and thoughtlessly, but his current training was different. He had an enemy to fight, and he was training on how to defeat that enemy. In this practical training, Seo Dae-ryong was truly entering the path of a warrior.


“My lord, I want to become stronger!”


There comes a time when you don’t just want to play around and vaguely become stronger, but when you’re working so hard that you can barely breathe, you really want to try harder. This is real determination.


“Okay, get stronger. I’ll watch over you.”


“You absolutely must see it.”




“Okay, I’ll definitely take a look.”


Seodaeryong was a small giant now. You may be grateful to me, but I am the one who is grateful. Because of you, who said that the school would not change at that moment, my return was able to find a direction.


When I returned after finishing my martial arts training with Seo Dae-ryong, Jin Ha-ryeong was at the inn.


“I don’t feel unfamiliar with that sight anymore. What brings you here today?”


Her expression was a little darker than usual.


“Is this the kind of face that needs some advice?”


“This is the advice the granddaughter of the Martial Arts Alliance leader receives from the son of the Demonic Cult leader. In the end, everything is revealed. Where is the Martial Arts Alliance’s forbidden area? To open the secret safe… … .”


“Up to there!”


“yes!”


Seo Dae-ryong went up to the guest room and I walked to the seat where she was sitting.


When Jin Ha-ryeong saw me, he immediately asked.


“When you cheered, you shouted for me to buy you noodles, right?”


“Have you heard?”


“Your words just stick in my ears.”


“I have a naturally loud voice.”


“sit down please.”


I sat down across from her.


She poured my glass full of wine.


“Are you good at drinking?”


“It depends on the position.”




“Where do you drink best? When you’re with good people?”


“No, when I’m with a good person, I get drunk quickly.”


“sure?”


“I drink a lot when I’m angry. I get so excited and talk a lot, so I sober up quickly. When I’m emotional, alcohol feels like water. Of course, I regret it the next day because of the hangover.”


“If I drink again, I’ll be a dog!”


“Yes, you know very well.”


We drank together. Jin Ha-ryeong said as he put down his empty glass.


“I feel like I can drink well today too.”


“Are you angry today too?”


“today?”


“Most of you come here angry, right?”


“You don’t come because you’re angry, you leave because you’re angry. Because of whom?”


I laughed at her words.


“Do you drink the alcohol that the servant serves you?”


“It depends on what kind of servant it is.”


I poured a drink into her glass. She stared at me intently and suddenly asked,


“Are you thinking of cutting that beard?”


“No, there isn’t.”


“Then, are you willing to be used for me? Just for one day.”


“there is.”




She looked at me with a surprised expression.


“Even if I can’t cut your beard, I’ll still let you use me?”


“Just one day? It takes a long time to grow a beard.”


“Aren’t you going to ask what’s going on?”


“It must be very difficult for you, young lady.”


“You might get into trouble. Someone might be upset. You might be insulted.”


“Holding grudges, being insulted. That’s the life of a servant. What could be more difficult?”


“Then please come to the Murim Alliance banquet with me tomorrow. You will also be able to meet my grandfather. Can you do it?”


I blinked for a moment and then answered.


“That’s a bit difficult.”


“You’re a coward.”


“That’s how it is for all servants, you know.”


Jin Ha-ryeong looked at me and smiled.


“I never intended to ask for help in the first place. I’m so caught up in my own work that I can’t look good. I appreciate even your words.”


She got up from her seat.


“Okay, I broke it one out of three times.”


Just then, a young man walked toward us.


“Miss Jin.”


The moment I saw him, I was inwardly surprised. It was someone I knew. And it was someone I had a direct connection with before my regression.


“This is Jo Shin of Jinryongjang. I’ve seen you before. You’ve become even more beautiful.”


courtier.


The courtier I know is not the courtier of Jinryongjang.


After Hwamugi went into hiding, he was the head of the Shinryong family, a new family that rose to prominence in the Jeongpa martial arts world. The current Jinryongjang changed its name to Shinryong family when that head became the head of the family and continued to rise. After the Murim Alliance was established, it grew to become a sect representing the Jeongpa.


This is the very same family that went to get the second ingredient of the Return Method, the Shin-Oh Hyang-Ro.


‘Around this time, when you were young, you approached Jin Ha-ryeong.’


I know very well what kind of person Cho Shin is.


He was a typical false gentleman. He lived the life of a great knight while deeply hiding his cruel and ruthless nature. He did not care about the means and methods for his own success, and he felt no remorse at all about it.


What if the courtiers of that time and the courtiers of today had the same personalities?


My gaze turned to Jinharyeong.


This woman is in danger now.


Could it be that her life turned out that way because of Lee Ja and not because of Cheonmyeonghoe?


Jo Shin looked at me and asked.


“Who is this person here?”


Our eyes met. She smiled faintly and said.


“Don’t worry about it, I’m just a servant.”
