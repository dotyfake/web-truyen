 Chapter 112 – The Final Gate (3)


 As Yeom Ga from the Vermillion Slaughter Cave drew 五 (five), Mok Gyeong-un naturally became 二 (two).


 Mu Jang-yak, who was confident in winning despite drawing the most troublesome opponent, extended his hand to Mok Gyeong-un and said,


 “We ended up facing each other like this. Regardless of who wins, let’s do our best.”


 At these words, Mok Gyeong-un grabbed his hand and spoke as if it was troublesome.


 “Uh. That seems difficult.”


 “What?”


 “If I do my best, the match will become too boring, so I’ll go easy on you. So you do your best.”


 ‘!?’


 Mu Jang-yak always had a relaxed demeanor, but at this moment, one of his eyebrows twitched, revealing his emotions.


 Was Mok Gyeong-un provoking him now?


 Mu Jang-yak looked straight into Mok Gyeong-un’s eyes.


 Unlike his own heightened state, Mok Gyeong-un’s eyes showed no particular emotion.


 

 Seeing this, Mu Jang-yak calmed his briefly surging emotions and regained his composure.


 ‘…Has it already started?’


 It was undoubtedly a clear provocation.


 The fellow was as good at strategy as he was, if not better.


 Perhaps he was trying to unsettle him before the match to gain an advantageous position.


 At this, Mu Jang-yak spoke with a smile.


 “I’m grateful that you’re going easy on me. I was already at an advantage, but if that’s the case, I’ll have an overwhelming advantage. Are you not interested in the top disciple position in the final gate?”


 This was an eye for an eye.


 Mu Jang-yak also deliberately provoked Mok Gyeong-un.


 However, Mok Gyeong-un showed no particular reaction to Mu Jang-yak’s provocation.


 Rather, he smirked and turned his head away.


 ‘……’


 Seeing this, Mu Jang-yak clicked his tongue inwardly.


 Since childhood, he had often been told that he was as cunning as he was talented in martial arts.


 So he was confident that he wouldn’t lose to anyone in a battle of wits or arguments, but strangely, whenever he had a conversation with this fellow, he felt like he was being swayed.


 ‘No need to fall for the provocation.’


 The outcome would be decided in the match anyway.


 He also intended to ignore it and move on.


 However,


 “…Hey. Mok Gyeong-un.”


 Mu Jang-yak called out to Mok Gyeong-un while looking ahead.


 After calling out, Mu Jang-yak inwardly regretted his actions, but since he had already called out, he thought it couldn’t be helped.


 “Why are you doing this?”


 At Mok Gyeong-un’s question, Mu Jang-yak said,


 “Since we’re having a match, how about we make a bet?”


 “A bet?”


 “Yeah.”


 “Why should I do that?”


 Mok Gyeong-un spoke in a tone as if he didn’t understand.


 At this, Mu Jang-yak smirked and replied,


 “You don’t have to do it if you’re not confident.”


 “Confidence?”


 “Yeah. I thought it would be more interesting to have a bet rather than just a match, but if you’re not confident, there’s no need to do it.”


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c4f98310f240f4d43d687", id: "pf-8947-1"}) It was a clear provocation.


 He could have just let it slide, but Mu Jang-yak, who thought he should clarify this relationship in this match, tried to draw Mok Gyeong-un into a bet.


 “Hmm.”


 Mok Gyeong-un stroked his chin and then smirked, saying,


 “What kind of bet do you want to make?”


 At these words, Mu Jang-yak inwardly cheered, although he didn’t show it, thinking that Mok Gyeong-un had fallen for his provocation.


 Since the opponent had fallen for his provocation, all that was left was to set the stakes.


 Mu Jang-yak used his brain in an instant.


 Although he had suggested a bet to provoke him, he didn’t want to create a situation where the opponent would resent or be angry even if they lost.


 So the idea he came up with was,


 “How about the loser of the match calling the winner ‘big brother’?”


 “Big brother?”


 “Yeah. Isn’t it about clearly establishing a hierarchy between us?”


 “Hierarchy…”


 “It’s not a bad bet, right? No matter how much of a competition it is, we’re not mortal enemies or enemies that need to be killed, so there’s no need to raise the stakes of the bet.”


 It was enough to create a sense of urgency that he had to win.


 At his words, Mok Gyeong-un let out a soft groan and said,


 “Hmm. That’s a rather boring bet.”


 “It’s boring?”


 “Yes. Is there even a need to make a bet with such a thing?”


 Did he fall for it or not?


 Mu Jang-yak asked in puzzlement,


 “…Then what do you think is an interesting bet?”


 “Well. How about the loser of the match becoming the faithful dog of the winner?”


 “What?”


 At Mok Gyeong-un’s words, Mu Jang-yak’s expression stiffened.


 He had mentioned the bet at a level where both of them wouldn’t feel too offended in case of any eventuality, but the fellow went a step further.


 Becoming a faithful dog basically meant crawling under him.


 ‘He’s not just good at provocation but excessive.’


 He was someone who usually laughed off and let go of most things, but this time, it was difficult to laugh.


 He was the one who first proposed the bet.


 But if he were to avoid it now that the stakes of the bet had been raised, he would look ridiculous.


 Mu Jang-yak slightly turned his head and looked at Mok Gyeong-un.


 ‘Is he that confident? Or is he going to provoke me until the end?’


 It didn’t matter either way.


 The latter was definitely effective.


 From the moment he suggested making a bet to determine who would be the elder or younger brother, he had already been caught in the fellow’s provocation.


 Mu Jang-yak clenched his fist as if he had made up his mind and said,


 “Are you sure you won’t regret it?”


 “That’s what I want to ask you.”


 “…You’re really something. I’ve never been caught by anyone in an argument or something like this. Fine. Let’s do it. The bet about becoming a faithful dog if you lose.”


 It would be fine as long as he won.


 Although Mok Gyeong-un had a special power, this was a match where martial arts would be compared.


 He was confident that no one could match him if it was solely based on martial arts.


 Because he had ‘that’.


 \*\*\*


 And so, the two trainees belonging to the first bracket of the final gate walked to the center of the plaza, faced each other, and stretched their bodies.


 They were Mok Gyeong-un and Mu Jang-yak.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c50524a5a770dd7e4e350", id: "pf-8948-1"}) The observers sitting next to the stage in the plaza had various expressions on their faces.


 Among them, the Bright Blade King Son Yun, who had come to confirm Mok Gyeong-un’s martial arts skills, was surprised by something unexpected.


 Son Yun gestured for one of the red-belted warriors to come and asked,


 “What was that child’s name again?”


 “It’s Mu Jang-yak.”


 “Mu Jang-yak? Do you know which martial clan he’s from?”


 “He seems to be from a small to medium-sized faction under our sect, but I don’t know much else.”


 At the warrior’s words, Son Yun’s eyes narrowed.


 Such a child was from a small to medium-sized faction that wasn’t well-known?


 At that moment, the Thunderbolt Fist King Won Byeong-hak, who was sitting right next to the Bright Blade King Son Yun, also spoke in a surprised tone,


 “This is surprising. Was there such a child?”


 “You noticed it too, my lord?”


 The energy emanating from Mu Jang-yak as he was stretching his body.


 They sensed it through their energy perception.


 ‘That child… has reached the pinnacle-stage of Peak realm.’


 For a trainee who was only seventeen or eighteen years old to have reached the pinnacle-stage of Peak Realm…


 If their energy perception wasn’t wrong, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he was the most outstanding among those six.


 It was truly unexpected.


 For such an outstanding martial talent to emerge from a small to medium-sized faction…


 ‘The opponent is unfavorable.’


 After looking at Mu Jang-yak like this, the Bright Blade King Son Yun, who turned his gaze to Mok Gyeong-un, clicked his tongue inwardly.


 He had wanted to confirm the extent of Mok Gyeong-un’s skills, who had defeated his disciple Yeop Wi-seon, but the opponent was too bad.


 Of all people, he had to face such a monstrous fellow.


 ‘If he hasn’t prepared anything, it might end uneventfully.’


 It was difficult to judge everything based solely on energy perception, but there was too much of a difference in the energy emanating from them.


 No matter how much Mok Gyeong-un had honed his energy, it seemed difficult for him to be a match.


 On the other hand, the Thunderbolt Fist King Won Byeong-hak, who had no particular interest in Mok Gyeong-un from the beginning, clicked his tongue while looking at Mu Jang-yak.


 ‘…Was I too hasty?’


 He had come with the sole purpose of bringing the child from the Esoteric Realm Gate.


 So he had already reached an agreement with a few of the observers beforehand.


 But to think there was such a talent…


 Although he tried not to show it, he felt regretful.


 ‘I can’t back out now.’


 Won Byeong-hak glanced at the other executives.


 The Shadow Clan Master and the Summoning Sound Valley Master Hang Yeo-ryang were sitting side by side, separated from them on the left side.


 The two of them also seemed to be having a conversation while looking at Mu Jang-yak.


 Hang Yeo-ryang spoke to the Shadow Clan Master in an interested tone,


 “I came to take a girl, but there’s a not-so-bad boy among the boys.”


 “A girl? Could it be that you’ve set your eyes on the child from the Demon Fire Hall?”


 “Hohoho. I heard she’s a promising talent.”


 “Hmm. This is quite troubling. I also came to Corpse Blood Valley after a long time because I was attracted to the child from the Demon Fire Hall.”


 “Oh my. Is that so? We have overlapping interests.”


 “It turned out that way unintentionally. Ohoho.”


 The Shadow Clan Master laughed like a woman, covering his mouth.


 Following the Shadow Clan Master, the Summoning Sound Valley Master Hang Yeo-ryang also laughed, giggling.


 They were both laughing, but for some reason, it sounded like they were having a battle of wits.


 Then, Hang Yeo-ryang pointed at Mu Jang-yak and said,


 “Clan Leader, why don’t you take that child instead? In terms of talent, he seems to be the best among this class.”


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) “Well.”


 The Shadow Clan Master showed a contemplative expression while stroking his chin.


 At this, the Summoning Sound Valley Master Hang Yeo-ryang spoke in a tone as if she couldn’t understand,


 “Is there a reason to hesitate? Could it be that you’re worried about the Thunderbolt Fist King and the Bright Blade King snatching him away?”


 “Ohoho. That’s one reason, but my eyes are drawn to that child.”


 “That child?”


 At the Shadow Clan Master’s words, the Summoning Sound Valley Master Hang Yeo-ryang looked at Mok Gyeong-un, who was lightly stretching his body on the opposite side of Mu Jang-yak.


 Although they were far apart, she was quite surprised by his handsome face.


 However, that was all.


 Based on energy perception, he seemed to be only at the first-rate level.


 At that age, being first-rate wasn’t weak, but it was definitely not a level worth coveting as a disciple.


 At this, she said,


 “His appearance is quite pleasing, but that’s all. Surely you’re not interested in him because of his appearance, are you?”


 “Ohohoho. As they say, beauty is the icing on the cake, so it’s good if the appearance is outstanding as well.”


 “If that’s all, it’s meaningless.”


 “Since he has come this far, wouldn’t he have a hidden technique or two?”


 “Well, that could be possible.”


 In the martial world, secret techniques and hidden skills existed.


 However, the opponent was too strong.


 Based on energy perception alone, that child named Mu Jang-yak had the potential to reach the initial-stage Transcendent Realm at any time as long as he was supported by enlightenment.


 Although she had originally set her sights on Mo Ha-rang, he was desirable to the point of coveting.


 Then, Hang Yeo-ryang spoke as if it was for amusement,


 “Then, Shadow Clan Master. Shall we have a light bet?”


 “A bet?”


 “Yes. From what I hear, it seems you see potential in that child as well, so let’s bet that the match will be decided within three moves. Of course, the winner will be that child named Mu Jang-yak.”


 “Hmm. What are the conditions of the bet?”


 “How about betting the ownership of that girl?”


 

 “So that was your objective, Valley Master.”


 “Hohoho. You caught me.”


 Hang Yeo-ryang preferred girls over boys.


 Since they both wanted the same thing, she proposed a bet to resolve it amicably.


 At this, the Shadow Clan Master smiled and said,


 “Not a bad idea. But since anyone can see the clear gap between those two children if we bet on the outcome, let’s do it this way.”


 “What do you mean by ‘this way’?”


 “I will bet that the match won’t be decided within three moves.”


 At the Shadow Clan Master’s words, the Summoning Sound Valley Master Hang Yeo-ryang twitched her lips and then nodded.


 “You won’t go back on your word, right?”


 “Ohoho. A man’s word is as good as a thousand gold pieces.”


 “……”


 It seemed like a phrase that didn’t suit him, but it didn’t matter.


 Hang Yeo-ryang was confident that the match could be decided in just one move, let alone three.


 The gap between the pinnacle-stage of Peak Realm and a First-Rate Realm was too large.


 It might not even take one move, but if done well, the outcome could be determined in just one move.


 \*\*\*


 Corpse Blood Valley Leader Lee Ji-yeom, who was on the stage, raised his hand and shouted,


 “Now, exchange greetings with each other.”


 At this, Mok Gyeong-un and Mu Jang-yak, who had been stretching their bodies, looked at each other and cupped their hands together in a salute.


Updat𝒆d fr𝒐m freewebnσvel.cøm.

 As it was a match, they were told to exchange greetings as a sign of mutual respect.


 While saluting, Mu Jang-yak glanced at someone next to the stage.


 ‘The Thunderbolt Fist King.’


 He was the one Mu Jang-yak wanted to have as his master.


 The Thunderbolt Fist King was one of the top three masters in the Heaven and Earth Society when it came to bare-handed techniques.


 His family was skilled in leg techniques and fist techniques, so Mu Jang-yak wanted to become his disciple and reach an even higher level.


 To make that happen as he wished, he had to become the top disciple in the final gate.


 Mu Jang-yak turned his gaze and looked at Mok Gyeong-un.


 Although he seemed to be only at the first-rate level based on appearance, after observing him several times, Mok Gyeong-un was estimated to be at Peak Realm.


 He didn’t know how he had concealed his martial arts, but he definitely wasn’t first-rate.


 Mu Jang-yak steeled his resolve while looking at Mok Gyeong-un.


 ‘Establish a clear superiority.’


 For the sake of the bet, he absolutely couldn’t lose.


 Mu Jang-yak began to rapidly circulate the internal energy from his danjeon throughout his body.


 It was to decide the match early on, along with the signal from the Corpse Blood Valley Leader.


 ‘Absolutely no carelessness.’


 From the start, he would use his full strength to break the fellow’s will and achieve victory.


 While they were doing so, Corpse Blood Valley Leader Lee Ji-yeom lowered his raised hand and shouted loudly,


 “Begin!”


 As soon as Lee Ji-yeom’s signal fell,


 Pat!


 Mu Jang-yak, who had been preparing by circulating energy throughout his body, kicked off the ground and launched himself towards Mok Gyeong-un.


 ‘Fast.’


 Mok Yoo-cheon, who was watching this, exclaimed in admiration.


 He had guessed that Mu Jang-yak would be strong, but his current movement exceeded expectations.


 Indeed, he seemed to have reached the pinnacle-stage of Peak Realm.


 ‘Flowing Water Stirs Chaos[1]!’


 Papapapapak!


 Mu Jang-yak, who had charged in front of Mok Gyeong-un in an instant, unleashed a palm technique.


 The elegant palm strikes, like gentle ripples, beautifully weaved a pattern, targeting the vital points on Mok Gyeong-un’s upper body.


 ‘How will you respond?’


 Mu Jang-yak thought as he glared at Mok Gyeong-un.


 Even if they had reached the same Peak Realm, those who had reached the peak were completely different in terms of strength and speed.


 Tak!


 At that moment, Mok Gyeong-un moved back about half a step.


 Then,


 Swish! Swish! Swish! Swish!


 ‘!?’


 Mu Jang-yak’s eyes narrowed.


 Mok Gyeong-un secured a distance of half a step and flexibly moved his upper body, dodging all the palm strikes.


 To easily evade the Flowing Water Swaying Disorder, where it was difficult to distinguish between false and true strikes?


 It was an unexpected response.


 “Oh my.”


 The Thunderbolt Fist King Won Byeong-hak, who was watching their confrontation from beside the stage, couldn’t hide his astonishment.


 Mok Gyeong-un’s movement was not at all that of a first-rate martial artist.


 To dodge techniques in such a manner, one had to be at a somewhat equal level.


 ‘Did he conceal his martial arts?’


 He had thought the match would end blandly.


 However, with the movement Mok Gyeong-un had shown now, it became difficult to predict the outcome.


 ‘…As expected.’


 The Bright Blade King Son Yun was also intently watching Mok Gyeong-un’s movement.


 He had thought there would be a hidden technique, and indeed, Mok Gyeong-un was showing movements that surpassed the first-rate level.


 If it was to that extent, it wouldn’t be an exaggeration to say that he had reached the proficient-stage of the Peak Realm or was close to the pinnacle-stage of Peak Realm.


 ‘Can he conceal his energy?’


 Even he, who had reached the Transcendent Realm, couldn’t accurately assess Mok Gyeong-un’s martial arts.


 It meant one of two things.


 Either Mok Gyeong-un was a peerless master far superior to himself, or he had a special technique to conceal his energy.


 However, the former was impossible based on common sense, so the latter was more likely.


 ‘No wonder that child was pushed back.’


 Mok Gyeong-un’s current movement was a step above Yeop Wi-seon.


 It could be confirmed just by seeing how he dodged the techniques.


 With this, it became difficult to predict who would win between the two of them.


 Papapapak!


 “An opening.”


 Mok Gyeong-un, who had dodged all the palm techniques, stepped forward and threw a punch, aiming for Mu Jang-yak’s face.


 In response, Mu Jang-yak leaped back to avoid the punch, and at the same time, he kicked off the ground and raised his foot towards Mok Gyeong-un’s chin.


 Pak!


 Mok Gyeong-un blocked Mu Jang-yak’s instep and simultaneously tried to grab it.


 However,


 Swish!


 Mu Jang-yak twisted his body and kicked Mok Gyeong-un’s shoulder with his foot.


 Bam!


 Shuaaa!


 Mok Gyeong-un’s body was pushed back about five steps.


 Landing on the ground and seeing this, the corners of Mu Jang-yak’s mouth slightly rose.


 He was now certain about this.


 Mok Gyeong-un’s internal energy was weaker than his own.


 In that case,


 ‘Let’s decide the match.’


 Pat!


 Mu Jang-yak kicked off the ground and unleashed a fist technique with his right hand towards the pushed-back Mok Gyeong-un.


 ‘Accumulating Fists, Dancing to Completion[2]!’


 As the fists overlapped, they flew in with several false strikes, swaying like a butterfly.


 Seeing this, Mok Gyeong-un tried to increase the distance by using footwork.


 However, Mu Jang-yak’s fist technique, like the Hundred Steps Divine Fist of Shaolin, imbued with energy, pierced through the air as much as the distance widened and charged forward.


 ‘I have no choice but to block.’


 There was no other way; he had to use his hands.


 Mok Gyeong-un raised his energy and extended his palm to block the fist technique.


 But at that moment,


 Bam!


 From an angle he had never imagined, Mu Jang-yak’s palm strike pierced Mok Gyeong-un’s right rib cage.


 ‘Huh?’


 Mok Gyeong-un’s body bent sideways to the right.


 Along with that, Mu Jang-yak’s Accumulating Fists, Dancing to Completion’s fist technique struck his chest.


 Bam! Bam! Bam! Bam!


 Consecutive strikes were delivered, and Mok Gyeong-un’s body was pushed back more than ten steps.


 Shuaaa!


 “Ha!”


 Exclamations of admiration flowed from various parts of the spectator seats.


 That was because the technique Mu Jang-yak had shown just now was something no one had expected.


 Even the Bright Blade King Son Yun muttered in amazement,


 “…Right Fist, Left Palm[3].”


 With his right hand, he unleashed a fist technique, and with his left hand, he unleashed a palm technique.


 It was unbelievable.


 It wasn’t that he was using the same technique with both hands, but he was using different techniques with each hand.


 “Oh my…”


 The Thunderbolt Fist King Won Byeong-hak also couldn’t hide his astonishment at Mu Jang-yak’s bizarre technique.


 At a glance, it seemed like a simple principle, but those who had learned martial arts knew that this was nearly impossible.


 Using different techniques with each hand meant having to think two things simultaneously, and if not careful, the energy circulation system could get tangled.


 ‘To have mastered such a bizarre technique.’


 He was truly an amazing child.


 Using two different techniques with one body.


 It was no different from facing two masters who had reached the pinnacle-stage of Peak Realm.


 ‘The match has tilted.’


 Regardless of how he did it, if it had come to this, it was no exaggeration to say that the situation had already tilted in Mu Jang-yak’s favor.


 Even without this, Mok Gyeong-un’s cultivation seemed to be a step below Mu Jang-yak’s, so by what means could he defeat such a monster?


 ‘…That will be difficult.’


 The Bright Blade King Son Yun also shared the same opinion.


 It was surprising that Mok Gyeong-un had concealed his skills, but the opponent was too bad.


 However,


 ‘What?’


 Mu Jang-yak, who had landed two techniques that were practically fatal blows to Mok Gyeong-un, didn’t have a good expression.


 He had accurately hit two techniques with his hidden skill, Right Fist, Left Palm.


 The rib cage and the center of the chest.


 It was no exaggeration to say that these were fatal blows.


 However, at the same time he landed the techniques, he felt a strange sensation of his cultivation dispersing for a moment.


 ‘…Is it my imagination?’


 At that moment, Mok Gyeong-un, who had been pushed back about ten steps, straightened his body and cracked his neck.


 Crack! Crack!


 Then, he muttered as if talking to himself,


 “Ahh. I was going to finish it by dealing with you moderately, but this was unexpected.”


 ‘What?’


 Mu Jang-yak furrowed his brows.


 After being hit by unexpected killing techniques consecutively, he was still putting on such a pretentious act, which was really something.


 It seemed he needed to finish it decisively.


 ‘I’ll put an end to that pretentiousness.’


 Pat!


 

  Mu Jang-yak launched himself towards Mok Gyeong-un.


 Having revealed his hidden skill, he now intended to unleash it openly.


 ‘Right Fist, Left Palm[3]. Fists Vast as the World[4]! Flowing Water, Moving Clouds[5]!’


 Simultaneously unleashing fist and palm techniques.


 It created a situation as if two masters were attacking together.


 ‘It’s over!’


 Just as he was certain of that,


 “Is this roughly how it’s done?”


 Papapapapak!


 At that moment, Mu Jang-yak couldn’t hide his shock.


 Mok Gyeong-un, who had been staring intently at him as he charged forward, nodded his head and then, like Mu Jang-yak, started using different techniques with each hand.


 ‘!!!!!!!!!’
