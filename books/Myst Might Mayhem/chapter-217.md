 Chapter 217 – Craftsman (1)


 A single stance consisting of 24 sword techniques.


 Witnessing this, Cheong-ryeong was left speechless.


 When told not to be bound by fixed notions, he created a stance that defied common sense.


 Throughout her life and even in death, she had thought about the sword for so long, but she had never considered increasing the number of techniques in this manner.


 In the first place, it wasn’t something that could be achieved simply by increasing the number of techniques.


 -You… how…


 “Phew. Phew. It seems it will take some time to get used to this.”


 She was dumbfounded by Mok Gyeong-un’s nonchalant attitude.


 With each additional sword technique, the number of movements naturally increased, inevitably straining the muscles.


 Moreover, if a single stance was like this, performing twenty-four stances was equivalent to not only overexerting the body but pushing it to its limits.


 ‘…What a monstrous fellow.’


 This sword technique was not something that could be executed in a short period of time.


 

 It was a sword technique that would be challenging to execute even after several years of training, yet this punk, Mok Gyeong-un, visualized it in his mind and physically manifested it in a single attempt.


 Calling it innate talent was an understatement.


 Astonished, Cheong-ryeong finally managed to suppress her amazement and asked.


 -How did you come up with this?


 “I’m not sure. When I saw the swordsmanship of that elder, I noticed that within its simplicity lay complexity. However, I felt that with my current abilities, I wouldn’t be able to wield such a sword.”


 The swordsmanship the old man had demonstrated became increasingly simple.


 Yet, within that simplicity, Mok Gyeong-un sensed profound principles.


 At this point, Mok Gyeong-un realized that it was not something that could be achieved by merely imprinting it with the eyes and memorizing it.


 “In that case, I thought if I were to manifest all the ideal trajectories to thoroughly slay an opponent, wouldn’t it become a nearly flawless sword technique?”


 -Ha!


 At Mok Gyeong-un’s words, Cheong-ryeong clicked her tongue.


 They had witnessed the old man’s swordsmanship together, so how could the results be so different?


 No, perhaps it was possible because it was him.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c4f98310f240f4d43d687", id: "pf-8947-1"}) In the first place, since he hadn’t learned the sword for long, there were no limits to his imagination.


 ‘I have no choice but to acknowledge it.’


 Mok Gyeong-un’s sword talent had already surpassed her own.


 With him, reaching the pinnacle of swordsmanship that all swordsmen dreamed of might be possible.


 \*\*\*


 Two days later.


 The imperial capital, Kaifeng.


 Upon arriving in Kaifeng, Mok Gyeong-un’s group couldn’t help but express their sincere admiration.


 They knew it was called the center of the Central Plains and, being the imperial capital, it would naturally be prosperous, but its scale was incomparable to even the outer city of the Heaven and Earth Society, considered the largest among single forces.


 The outer city of the imperial capital seemed to stretch endlessly, and even reaching the outer walls, which could be seen in the distance, would likely take more than half an hour by carriage.


 As everyone marveled at the city, there was one individual who seemed restless with a darkened expression.


 It was the Demon-Subduing monk, Ja Geum-jeong.


 Seop Chun asked, puzzled.


 “Are you feeling unwell? Your complexion has been poor since yesterday… Wait, are your hands trembling?”


 Ja Geum-jeong’s hands were even shaking.


 Seeing this, Seop Chun expressed concern.


 However, Ja Geum-jeong shook his head and said.


 “We need to find it… quickly.”


 “Find what? Are you looking for a doctor?”


 “No. Help me find an inn or a tavern.”


 “…”


 Seop Chun stared intently at Ja Geum-jeong’s face.


 Come to think of it, he had been complaining about running out of alcohol since yesterday afternoon.


 So, was he experiencing withdrawal symptoms from not drinking?


 “…You’re quite something.”


 This level of addiction was almost severe.


 No matter how skilled he was, could his liver withstand drinking so much?


 Shaking his head, Seop Chun glanced at Gan-yang, the leader of the advance team guiding them.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c50524a5a770dd7e4e350", id: "pf-8948-1"}) After entering the city, Yoo-bong, the eunuch of the imperial palace, had left midway.


 He said he would go ahead and prepare for the meeting with Noble Imperial Concubine Seo.


 The place they were currently heading to was Hong Bong Meat, the largest slaughterhouse in the capital city.


 The reason they were heading to the largest slaughterhouse was simple.


 [There is a highly skilled craftsman there.]


 \*\*\*


 “It’s huge.”


 Mok Gyeong-un remarked upon seeing the slaughterhouse.


 Typically, a slaughterhouse is divided into four areas: the cattle and pig pens, the meat storage, the slaughter area, and the vendor stalls.


 However, the scale of these four areas was much larger than an ordinary estate.


 Pointing to it, Gan-yang from the advance team said.


 “There are a thousand cattle and pigs inside. Naturally, it’s operated on this scale.”


 “I see.”


 “Since this place also supplies meat to the imperial palace, I’ve heard they only handle the highest quality. You’ll understand once we go inside.”


 With that, they entered through the main gate of the slaughterhouse.


 As they stepped inside, the smell of cattle and pig feces and the stench of blood assaulted their nostrils.


 It certainly seemed like a slaughterhouse.


 -Buzzing noise!


 Inside the main gate, there were vendor stalls with meat sorted by parts, and in front of them, a large crowd of customers had gathered.


 “Tsk tsk. There are so many bodhisattvas obsessed with meat.”


 Ja Geum-jeong clicked his tongue and spoke.


 Despite being a Demon-Subduing monk, he surprisingly refrained from eating meat even after leaving Shaolin.


 Therefore, he seemed displeased with the slaughterhouse.


 With a puzzled expression, Seop Chun said to Gan-yang.


 “Is there really a ‘craftsman’ in a place like this?”


 No matter how he looked at it, this place was too conspicuous.


 Even if it’s darkest under the lamp, it was too crowded.


 Moreover, if this place supplied meat even to the imperial palace, wouldn’t officials frequently visit here? Could they really carry out such a task?


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) “That’s correct. So, don’t worry too much.”


 “Hmm.”


This chapter is updated by freēwēbnovel.com.

 Seop Chun still seemed dissatisfied.


 Just then, among those near the vendor stalls, a hairy man noticed their group carrying weapons, unlike the other customers, and approached them.


 “My lords, what brings you here?”


 In response to his question, Gan-yang took out a prepared token from his bosom and handed it over.


 Then, he casually said.


 “We’re here to select some good rind meat. May we take a look?”


 Upon receiving the token, the man examined it closely and then revealed his yellow teeth, saying.


 “If you’re looking for rind, pork rind is the best when grilled.”


 “Pork rind sounds good. We’d like to select the meat to be slaughtered. Is that alright?”


 “Why wouldn’t it be? I’ll guide you, so please follow me.”


 With that, the hairy man pointed to a pavilion and took the lead to guide them.


 However, as Mok Gyeong-un was about to follow behind him, he suddenly paused.


 Noticing this, Mong Mu-yak, who was beside him, asked.


 “My lord, why are you hesitating?”


 “…”


 Without answering the question, Mok Gyeong-un turned his head and looked towards the main gate.


 -Rumbling noise!


 The sound of wheels rolling could be heard.


 Soon, the entire main gate opened, and individuals who appeared to be government slaves entered the square, pulling carts.


 However, Mok Gyeong-un’s gaze was not on them but on the person walking at the very back of the cart procession with his hands behind his back.


 He was wearing a blue flying fish robe and a unique patterned mask.


 Behind him, four individuals wearing navy blue flying fish robes with their faces covered in cotton cloth were also following.


 They seemed to be officials, but all of them…


 “They have cultivated martial arts.”


 At Mok Gyeong-un’s words, Mong Mu-yak frowned and said.


 “My lord, please turn your head and enter inside for now.”


 At Mong Mu-yak’s urging, Mok Gyeong-un turned his head and followed the group beyond the pavilion.


 As they moved away from the square, Mong Mu-yak spoke in a low voice.


 “What a coincidence.”


 “Why do you say that?”


 “The officials in flying fish robes earlier are from the Embroidered Uniform Guards.”


 “The Embroidered Uniform Guards?”


 At these words, Mok Gyeong-un’s eyes sparkled with interest.


 He seemed to understand why Mong Mu-yak called it a coincidence.


 The identity they were trying to infiltrate for their secret mission was none other than the Embroidered Uniform Guards, so who would have thought they would encounter them by chance in a place like this?


 Mong Mu-yak clicked his tongue and said.


 “Yes, the Embroidered Uniform Guards.”


 “…Aren’t the Embroidered Uniform Guards the imperial palace guards?”


 “That’s right. It’s strange. Not even the Guard troops, but the Embroidered Uniform Guards in a place like this…”


 “What? The Embroidered Uniform Guards?”


 Seop Chun, who was walking ahead, interjected with a frown.


 Mong Mu-yak then said.


 “Shh. Be quiet. Right now, in the vendor square of the slaughterhouse, the Embroidered Uniform Guards…”


 Before he could finish his sentence, Gan-yang whispered.


 “You don’t need to concern yourselves too much. The Embroidered Uniform Guards personally inspects the meat that enters the inner palace since it’s used for the meals of the imperial family.”


 “Ah…”


 Handling food ingredients might seem trivial, but it wasn’t.


 Food ingredients and medicinal herbs were not only consumed by palace residents and officials but also by the imperial family and even the emperor, so the imperial palace paid the utmost attention to their inspection.


 Assassination attempts through food ingredients and medicinal herbs had been carried out since ancient times, making it particularly important.


 “I see. But do most of the Embroidered Uniform Guards cultivate martial arts?”


 “Yes. Since the Embroidered Uniform Guards are under the direct command of the emperor, I’ve heard that each of their martial arts is at least first-rate or above. Among those in high positions, there are quite a few who would be considered experts even in the martial arts world.”


 “What is the rank of the one wearing a blue official robe with a golden belt depicted with flying fish?”


 In response to that question, Gan-yang asked back with a somewhat surprised expression.


 “Did you say a blue official robe with a golden belt?”


 “Yes.”


 “A blue official robe with a golden belt indicates a Thousand-men Commander, a 5th-rank senior Embroidered Uniform Guards. With that rank, he must be a significant figure even within the Embroidered Uniform Guards.”


 The organizational structure of the Embroidered Uniform Guards’s executive ranks is as follows:


 Lesser Banner, Sogi (Junior 7th rank); Chief Banner, Chonggi (Senior 7th rank); Probationary 100-men Commander, Sibaekho (Junior 6th rank); One Hundred-men Commander, Baekho (Senior 6th rank); Deputy Thousand-men Commander, Bucheonho (Junior 5th rank); Thousand-men Commander, Cheonho (Senior 5th rank); Pacification Commissioner, Yukcheonho (Junior 4th rank); and Assistant Commander-in-Chief, Jinmusa (Senior 4th rank).


 [TL/N: Read more notes on the rankings after this chapter]


 “If he’s a significant figure, how skilled is he?”


 In response to Seop Chun’s question, Gan-yang stroked his beard and replied.


 “A Thousand-men Commander (Cheonho) of the 5th rank senior in the Embroidered Uniform Guards would be an expert who has at least reached the pinnacle-stage of Peak Realm.”


 “‘At least’? The imperial palace’s Embroidered Uniform Guards is no ordinary force.”


 “Yes. Since they have been exchanging with the righteous sects and recruiting many experts, their level has become much higher than before.”


 At Gan-yang’s words, Seop Chun grinned and said.


 “Hahaha. Still, if the level of a Thousand-men Commander is that high, if this friend or I join the Embroidered Uniform Guards, we would receive a rank of at least Pacification Commissioner or above.”


 Seop Chun and Mong Mu-yak were among the Five Tigers, the highest-level pinnacle-stage Transformation Realm warriors of the Heaven and Earth Society.


 With their martial arts approaching that of the executives, they were confident they could receive high ranks in the Embroidered Uniform Guards.


 At Seop Chun’s confidence, Mok Gyeong-un tilted his head and said.


 “I wonder about that.”


 “Pardon? Why do you say that?”


 “That Thousand-men Commander of the Embroidered Uniform Guards we saw earlier, the one with the mask…”


 “What about the Embroidered Uniform Guards?”


 Just as Mok Gyeong-un was about to say something, he shook his head and said.


 “Never mind.”


 Suddenly stopping mid-sentence, Seop Chun couldn’t help but feel uneasy.


 “Let’s go for now.”


 “…”


 He wanted to ask what Mok Gyeong-un was trying to say, but given his personality, it seemed unlikely he would answer.


 Curious, Cheong-ryeong asked.


 -What were you trying to tell him?


 -That masked Thousand-men Commander from earlier… he had sealed some of his qi points.


 -Sealed his qi points?


 -Yes.


 Mok Gyeong-un could see the general flow of qi with his naked eyes without opening the power of the Third Eye in his right eye.


 In Mok Gyeong-un’s eyes, the masked Embroidered Uniform Guards Thousand-men Commander had sealed three major qi points.


 So, based on the qi emanating from him, his level seemed to be at the pinnacle stage of Peak Realm, but…


 -If he unseals them, I don’t think Seop Chun would be a match for him.


 -Was he that skilled?


 -Yes.


 For some unknown reason, that person was sealing his own qi points to conceal his true abilities.


 Mok Gyeong-un was about to mention this but decided not to, as the conversation would have become lengthy.


 -But there was one more unusual thing.


 -What is it?


 -Through the gaps in the mask, I noticed that person’s eyes were blue.


 ‘!?’
