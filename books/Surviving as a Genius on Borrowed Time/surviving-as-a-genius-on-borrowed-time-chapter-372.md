# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 372 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Geumsimunju nhận được thông báo về một lễ hội võ thuật chưa từng có, nơi tập hợp các cao thủ. Geum Hui-cheol, hay còn gọi là Thiết Thần (Iron God), tức giận vì cho rằng đây là hành động điên rồ. Một người đàn ông khác giải thích rằng sự kiện này đã thu hút sự chú ý của toàn thế giới và được gọi là Đại Chiến Võ Thần (Great Battle of Musin), nơi các cao thủ giao đấu sinh tử. Người này khuyên Geumsimunju nên tham gia vì nhiều môn phái lớn đang biến mất một cách bí ẩn, và đây có thể là cơ hội để tiêu diệt các đối thủ nguy hiểm như Thanh Thành (Cheongseong) và A Mi (Ami). Geumsimunju đồng ý tham gia.

Trong khi đó, thông điệp của Jeongyeonshin được lan truyền rộng rãi nhờ sự giúp đỡ của gia tộc Tang (Tang family). Jeong Yeon-shin và Ma Gwang-ik-ju đi dạo trong vườn hoa, theo sau là So Il-su. Jeong Yeon-shin thắc mắc về việc một cao thủ như So Il-su lại phục vụ người khác.

Jeong Yeon-shin nghe thấy một giọng nói bí ẩn từ dưới chân mình, liên quan đến việc nhịn đói. Anh nhớ lại tuổi thơ khó khăn và nhận ra bí mật của Jeonggadonggong.

Khi đến một gian nhà do gia tộc Tang cung cấp, Jeong Yeon-shin nghĩ về việc gặp gỡ Noejeong Gwaneum (惱程觀音) - Baekyak (栢爚), người đứng đầu phái A Mi (Amipah). Cancelok lo lắng rằng Baekyak có thể không ủng hộ sự tham gia của Jeong Yeon-shin vào buổi lễ. Cô mô tả Baekyak là một người điềm tĩnh, không bị lay chuyển bởi bất cứ điều gì. Cancelok cũng nói rằng Baekyak dường như hoài nghi về sự tham gia của Jeong Yeon-shin vào buổi lễ.

Jeong Yeon-shin ngắt lời và bước vào, trong khi Cancelok gần như mất kiểm soát và cố gắng ngăn anh lại. Một lượng nhỏ năng lượng ma thuật thoát ra từ áo choàng của Ma Gwang-ik-ju và tan biến.

A single piece of paper was posted all over the city.


It was talking about a martial arts festival that had never been seen before. It was a phrase that called together the best martial artists of the time.


Who could refuse?


It shook the twelve provinces and seven states that make up the vast Sichuan Province.


It was a declaration of war that spread out endlessly, causing the entire Sacheon and even the land beyond to boil over.


Sarak.


The letter flew between Geumsimunju’s pure white index and middle fingers and got stuck in the gap.


At the same time, the Buddha statue that had been bouncing and spinning madly in the air on the other side suddenly fell with a thud. It was as if an invisible hand had suddenly disappeared.


“One-on-one? Or a winning streak…?”


She muttered in a small voice. The words that came out repeatedly were slightly high-pitched. She seemed to have lost interest in the Buddha statue she was playing with as a norigae.




A strong scent of wine spread from the jade bottle held in Geumsimunju’s other hand. This was because her body briefly gave off a cloud-like energy.


While the surrounding goldsmiths flinched in their own way.


“Magwangikju… mad. Truly mad.”


Iron God Geum Hui-cheol slammed the long sword he was holding into the ground.


In an instant, a blue light flashed and disappeared along the veins of his sturdy arms, which were unusual for his age. It was an internal energy that had been typified with a powerful feeling.


“This is ridiculous. He doesn’t know what he’s done.”


The old man chewed and spat out his thoughts. In the brief moment that the letter reached Geumsimunju’s hand, he scanned through all the lines.


Meanwhile, the man in Yeo-ryeong stared blankly at the figure of Geumsimunju standing in the bright sunlight, then came to his senses with a start.


It was the fault of the old man who had lost his temper.


The man cursed inwardly.




‘Ignorant old man.’


Iron God, Geum Hui-cheol.


He is a great sorcerer who can open a single sect. He is famous as the master who can receive the most of the sect master’s first recipes within the Geumsi sect.


It was different from Yongryong Shinkwon, who was captivated by Moonju’s beauty and acted as her servant the whole time.


He had a great deal of influence in the Geumsimun, to the point where he even took the lead in hunting the sect’s spirits, including the dragon hunters.


It was Geum Hui-cheol who gave the order to thoroughly crush the enemy sect in the Bangpa War.


A few days ago, Geumsimun burned down Amipa and played a major role in allowing it to remain there until today.


“He already had an unforgivable karma, yet he’s holding a ritual and asking to be killed. He’s nothing more than a subordinate of the leader of the Shingeomdan.”


Geum Hui-cheol was shocked.


Although he didn’t know who he was talking to, the man in Yeo-ryeong had to respond. It was difficult to talk directly with Geum-si-mun-ju for various reasons.




The man interrupted, blurting out:


“If you have a black color, you are not of a lower status anywhere. Not long ago, the Sipmunju and Sunmaryeonju withdrew due to a conflict with the Magwangikju… … .”


“There must have been some circumstances that were difficult to fathom here.”


“I guess so.”


“He is not purple. He does not need to be accompanied by a trivial rhythm. How dare a young man who does not even fit his status dare to ask the Lord to come and go… .”


The fist of Geum Hui-cheol, who was holding the handle of the sword, was tightening. The man who glanced at the sight shook his head internally. No, no.


“This has already attracted the attention of the entire world. In the fast-spreading world, it has even been called the Battle of the God of War.”


“The Great Battle of Musin?”


Geum Hui-cheol asked back. The man nodded slowly.


“It’s a non-competitive competition where high-class, peerless masters fight to the death. The game was set up very naturally. It’s extremely rare for the leaders of the big factions to get out of their own way.”


“Your Majesty is not a street clown.”


When Geum Hui-cheol was thinking that it was not worth a single word, the man with his eyebrows furrowed opened his mouth again. With a somewhat serious expression.


“It might be a hundred times better for you, Lord Geumsimunju, to walk there. That’s what I wanted to say.”


“What is the reason?”


“Don’t you know? Something very strange is happening. The whereabouts of the Sipjeonmun, Geumsimun, Sunmaryeon, Paegeomjong, and some of our Yeo-ryeong’s forces, as well as the whereabouts of so many subordinate sects, are disappearing sporadically? … Originally, the four Jeongdo Mumun and Shingeomdan armed forces of Sacheon should have been wiped out long ago.”


“hmm.”


“If it’s a place where you can kill not only Cheongseong and Ami’s long-suffering leader, but also Iphwangseong’s Ma Gwang-ik-ju in one place… I absolutely must attend. Since it’s been announced that it’s a non-combat event, it can’t be a trap. There won’t be any room to devise any plans before then.”


Cheongseongpa lost Jangmunin to Paegeomjongju once.


The Tang family would be busy trying to recover from the damage they had suffered from the Sipjeonmun and Sunmalyeon. There would only be a handful of poison and dark energy left.


Amipa added. Jangmunin was defeated by Geumsimunju while returning to his hometown after a long journey abroad, and even Amisan, famous for having all kinds of Buddhist treasures buried there, was taken away.




There’s no need to mention the Magwangikju. The Iphwangseong Shingeomdan will never unite.


‘The problem is the Cheonrimdae and Seonmokryeong that should have been in the original Kyoryong formation, but… … .’


There are certainly variables. But they are nothing compared to the Sipjeonmun, Sunmaryeon, and Geumsimun, whose leaders are still in good health.


This is especially true now that there are countless mountain sects, as well as the support of the Paegeomjong and Yeollyeong.


‘You’re going to hit thirteen thousand heads with something like a weapon?’


The young man made a meaningful expression.


‘It seems like they are trying to turn the tide of the situation… Chicheon Yongsalgong is not a human’s ignorance.’


The golden quill was reflected in his eyes. He was tracing the words of the Magwangikju with his slender fingertips.


Her ebony-like hair flows down her tiny ears, moving slightly with her movements.


It was a very insignificant thing, but strangely enough, it looked like a phoenix with a human form.


“Hwicheol.”


“Yes, Moonju.”


“I always said that. I’m going to go see it.”


“… I will follow your will.”


Cheolju Shindo Geum Hui-cheol answers in an old, haggard voice.

He bowed his head slightly. The real power he held came from the fact that the Geumsimunju did not pay attention to matters outside the sect.


I wonder how the Sacheon Jeongpa will be annihilated. The man muttered to himself.


Similar patterns will likely unfold in the Sipjeonmun and Sunmaryeon.


A secret plan by Ma Gwang-ik, who portrayed Kang Ho-in as a rice borer. It is impossible to refuse for those who care about their appearance. It was very clever.


‘If you write it like that, even if it’s a political party, they won’t look kindly on him… I guess they saw greater utility when the non-governmental organization was properly held.’


It is impossible for a person who is not even a minor to have such a crazy mind, so I could guess how much effort was put into each and every word of the content.


The man swallowed his regret, thinking that he should have come to Yeo-ryeong.


\* \* \*


The message that Jeongyeonshin had sent was being delivered to all sects.


This was despite the fact that the Bangpas, who were good at spreading or greatly exaggerating rumors such as Gae-bok and Yeo-ryeong, were not favorable to Ma Gwang-ik-ju.


This was because the Tang clan, which had ruled the Sacheon martial arts world for generations, provided great help.


“It’s really fortunate. Whether it’s using gold or commanding people, one Tang family is better than all of our families combined.”


“okay.”


A man and a woman walked through a flower garden filled with rare and colorful flowers and grasses.


After the sword fight, Jeong Yeon-shin and Ma Gwang-ik-ju followed suit. Behind them, a young man wearing white military attire followed Jeong Yeon-shin with careful steps like a servant.


It was the white warrior So Il-su who was almost killed by Sunmaryeonju earlier.


“By the way, even though the Tang family provides a servant, why on earth would that person… I’ve never encountered an elite warrior of the level of Baek Hwang-seong do something for someone else.”


“I’ll take a look at the soil,” said Chulgok.


Jeongyeon Shin nodded slowly.


“I am very grateful.”




“I asked because I wanted to! The branch members scattered all over the world like me are bound to idolize at least one of the seventeen black ones!”


Soilsu laughed and shouted.


Jeongyeonshin slightly turned her head to the side. It was to avoid showing an embarrassed expression to the two people. What about the idol?


at that time.


-You’re cute.


It is the realm of the law of soju.


It seemed as if a smooth laugh had been heard from the shadows beneath my feet. It was accompanied by the sound of a hungry stomach. It was mysterious and yet very trivial.


Jeongyeon Shin has starved before.


It was around the age of seven when I first heard my father personally read interesting stories like the Shan Hai Jing and the Dae Ming Gang Mu to my older brothers.


He was locked up for four days after insisting on talking about his mother. A child of a noble family should not have caused trouble.


Still, there were small achievements.


It was at that time that I realized the secret of the emptiness in the Jeonggadonggong that was already being created.


‘Empty it and fill it up. You already know that.’


Chilsado would not be worse than the seven-year-old Jeongyeonsin. Since his five natures and qualities are closer to humans than to beasts, he would have no reason to starve like he did that day.


Jeongyeonshin thought. If she drew blood from her finger and dropped a drop, wouldn’t it come out right away?


The feeling of the cool fangs of the Seven Sado’s head burying itself in the nape of his neck is still vivid.


“Your Majesty… Your Majesty?”


“hmm?”


“We’re all here. Turn right and it’s the first room.”


Cancelok said.




Suddenly, I raised my head and saw a pavilion with a blue-green tiled roof. It was very old-fashioned. I had arrived at the annex that the Dangmun gave to its distinguished guests.


It took some time. Right now, Jeongyeonshin is staying at the royal palace used by the direct descendants of the Tang family.


There was a calm and tranquil look in his eyes.


‘Is the monk Noejeong Gwaneum (惱程觀音) inside there…?’


It was the nickname of the head of the Amipah sect. His Buddhist name was Baekyak (栢爚).


Last night, after receiving the news, Jeong Yeon-sin went out to greet Xiahou Weijin and Tian Xiaosuo. While they were reuniting with their two seniors, he led the Ami masters into the Tang Gate.


I heard that he was completely defeated by Geum Si-moon. It was also reported that Jang Moon-in personally requested a meeting with Ma Gwang-ik-ju from Dang Ga-ju.


‘Do you want to decide the order of the martial arts?’


I thought as I walked.


Jeong Yeon-shin was the youngest child of a large landowner family and was originally close to the good common people.


It was because he alone had the martial arts that would be third-rate even if he learned them from someone else. He respected monks and Taoists like any other commoner.


If he is the head of the Amipa, he will be able to speak comfortably with the Shaolin abbot. He is truly of the highest status. Regardless of his status, he cannot help but be respected.


“Your Majesty.”


“hmm?”


“Can I say a few words before you go in?”


“…Tell me.”


Jung Yeon-shin, who was lost in thought, almost said to go ahead and talk. It was because of Hae-gyeong-ok’s sharp prayer that he couldn’t hide the energy wave.


The aftereffects of recently encountering many unpolished martial artists were significant.


‘The gangsters are no help.’


I ended my thoughts with a determination to be on guard against the darkness of the near future.




I was about to meet a great monk who had deeply practiced Buddhism. My heart was pounding.


Woof-


Suddenly, an invisible wave of energy trapped Jeongyeonshin and Haehwaok. It was a breathtaking energy that originated from Haehwaok’s body.


When Jeongyeonshin looked at her curiously, she opened her lips as if making an excuse.


“I was just worried that there might be unnecessary conflict.”


“Conflict? I heard that Master Baekyak possesses deep Buddhist powers.”


Cancellation Ok didn’t answer for a moment. She seemed to be swallowing her words with dry spit.


Jeongyeonshin’s colorless eyes shone like stars.


“Are you fiery-tempered? I’ve heard that there are monks like that. They say they send their worries into anger. Just take Shaolin’s Wall Tiger Fist… .”


“No, it’s the opposite.”


“what?”


“Even among the fourfold disciples, the Nojeong Gwaneum is called the Buddha of the Stone. They say that he is indifferent to all things and that his composure cannot be shaken. When he was young, Socheonmujeok tried to act like a heavenly demon in front of him but ran away. They say that he received the Gyocheonhwanheegong (交天歡喜功), which is said to be the best in the world at seducing people, without even raising his internal energy… … .”


“indeed.”


Jeong Yeon-shin, who had been secretly wary of her maternal bloodline since reuniting with her nephew, let out a short exclamation. I have to meet him right away.


The expression on Cancelok’s face took on a slightly urgent tone.


“I heard him talking to the Dang family, and he seemed skeptical about Prince Jeong’s participation in the non-combat ceremony. He is only interested in the orthodox Seon Buddhism that emphasizes enlightenment. So even if he is ignored for a moment… … .”


“That’s a strange story.”


Damn it.


Jeongyeonshin replied vaguely and left, breaking through the silence.


As he walked, fragments of his energy were shattered and remained like slivers of light, billowing behind his jet-black hair.




Cancellation Ok almost lost his mind for a moment and stared at the sight.


“Stop talking… …!”


She quickly reached out, then paused.


A small amount of magical energy flowed out like smoke from outside the black robe of the Magwangikju and disappeared.
