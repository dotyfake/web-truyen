 Chapter 447 – Wicked Heart Granny (6)


 Haa… Haa…


 Cheong-ryeong’s spirit body trapped in the silver wood prison was incredibly faint.


 She was already weakened due to the talisman formation and silver wood, but after using the Void Stabilizing Breath, which consumed the most energy among the subtleties of the Eight Thought-Shattering Techniques, she had reached a dangerous state.


 She tried to endure with all her might, but even her consciousness was gradually becoming hazy.


 ‘Mortal… I wonder if Mortal is alright?’


 Though she was on the verge of annihilation trying to save him, she didn’t regret it.


 Even if she couldn’t achieve her revenge, if she could save Mortal at this moment, she would be satisfied with that.


 That was her honest feeling.


 There was just one thing she regretted.


 ‘…It’s a shame… that I can’t… see you… before I go.’


 Beyond death, complete annihilation.


 The demise of a being without an afterlife, that’s what she regretted so much.


 

 As she grew faint, it became difficult even to keep her eyes open, and her eyelids began to close slowly.


 It was at that moment.


 -Bang!


 The door shattered and someone entered the thatched house.


 As she looked towards it with half-closed eyes,


 “Cheong-ryeong!”


 The voice she had longed to hear so much reached her ears.


 Her eyes, which had been about to disappear after consuming all her spirit energy, suddenly widened.


 Mok Gyeong-un, who approached where she was, ruthlessly tore off the talismans on the floor and then,


 -Crack!


 He shattered even the silver wood with his bare hands.


 The moment the talismans and silver wood were all broken, as the connection with the outside energy was fully restored, her body that had shrunk instantly returned to its original size.

 However, even though her size returned to normal, Cheong-ryeong’s spirit body was still incredibly faint due to the significant damage to her spirit energy.


 Seeing Mok Gyeong-un, Cheong-ryeong’s eyes reddened and she barely held back the tears that were about to pour out.


 -You… How did you…


 She had tried to detach him from her karma in every way possible.


 She didn’t want him to be hurt and suffer because of her, who would ultimately be annihilated no matter what.


 That’s why she had tried to shoulder everything herself somehow.


 But why was he still trying to approach her like this to the very end?


 -Thud!


 At that moment, Mok Gyeong-un grabbed both of Cheong-ryeong’s shoulders, and she could see the relief on his face.


 Seeing Mok Gyeong-un looking at her affectionately with a brightened face, Cheong-ryeong finally burst into tears.


 -Sob.


 Mok Gyeong-un hugged her tightly.


 Overwhelmed with emotion, she cried as she spoke to Mok Gyeong-un.

 -I’m sorry… I’m sorry… I should stay away… but the moment I see you… I hate myself for being so happy and relieved.


 “It’s okay. Everything’s okay.”


 Mok Gyeong-un comforted her, stroking her head while holding her.


 In his embrace, she couldn’t stop her tears and continued to cry pitifully.


 Although she thought she was prepared to shoulder everything, the moment she saw Mok Gyeong-un, it was difficult to control the emotions welling up from within.


 To her like this, Mok Gyeong-un said.


 “You told me to trust someone else. Now you trust me too.”


 -I… I…


 “I’ll protect you. So don’t ever leave my side.”


 -Swish!


 At these words from Mok Gyeong-un, Cheong-ryeong, who had been crying, embraced his body with both arms.


 She could no longer deny it.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c50524a5a770dd7e4e350", id: "pf-8948-1"}) That the part he occupied within her had grown too large.


 \*\*\*


 “Master Cheol Su-ryeon!”


 “Haa… Haa… I’ve shown an unsightly appearance. To that person’s blood relative.”


 Wicked Granny clicked her tongue, looking at her hands covered in wounds.


 If Mok Gyeong-un hadn’t deflected his power and stopped midway, her body might have really been cut in two.


 At this, she felt a thrill rather than anger.


 She had naturally thought that the greatest martial arts talent she had seen so far was that person.


 But this was truly indescribable.


 He was simply a monster incarnate.


 There were plenty of people who grew stronger while fighting, but that usually happened at more basic stages. he was reaching for an even higher dimension of swordsmanship at this level of realm.


 ‘A sword that surpasses the pinnacle of swordsmanship… What should I call this?’


 It was a sword that seemed to approach the very essence of swordsmanship.


 He stopped midway, but if he had completed this single strike full of killing intent’s single-minded focus, he would truly surpass the pinnacle of swordsmanship.


 Perhaps there would be nothing that sword couldn’t cut.


 As she kept marveling, Jin Ye-rin asked her.


 “Are you alright?”


 “Yes, I’m fine. Such wounds will heal quickly.”


 As she said, the blood flowing from her torn palms was gradually stopping.


 Wicked Granny Cheol Su-ryeon showed this and then asked.


 “But who exactly is that fellow?”


 “He’s someone who received teachings from Master Moon Evil Sword[1].”


 “Moon Evil Sword? Huh?”


 She wore an expression of disbelief.


 So this was why each of his sword techniques had felt somehow familiar.


 Wicked Granny Cheol Su-ryeon clicked her tongue and said.


 “That old… no, I didn’t know Moon Evil Sword was still alive. When that person invited him to come along, he said he would live according to the natural order and whatnot.”


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) “Ah…”


 “Ah, I apologize.”


 Thinking about it, if Jin Ye-rin was that person’s blood relative, she wasn’t unrelated to Moon Evil Sword.


 He was that person’s father-in-law, after all.


 Feeling like she had made a slip of the tongue, Cheol Su-ryeon apologized.


 “No, no. It’s alright.”


 Jin Ye-rin shook her head at this.


 She had heard from her father that Wicked Granny Cheol Su-ryeon had lived even longer than the Elder.


 But that wasn’t important right now.


 “More importantly, I apologize for being discourteous as soon as we met, Master Cheol Su-ryeon.”


 -Thud!


 Jin Ye-rin clasped her hands in a salute to her.


 At this, Wicked Granny Cheol Su-ryeon waved her hands, trying to undo her salute.


 “No, you don’t need to mind such things. I am that person’s faithful servant. You, being that person’s blood relative, don’t need to show such a gesture.”


 “No. Even if you served that person, what I’m about to say will be disrespectful to you, Master Cheol Su-ryeon.”


 “Disrespectful?”


 -Thud!


 Jin Ye-rin knelt on both knees on the ground, not satisfied with just a salute.


 

 “No, what are you doing? Please get up quickly.”


 “No. I can’t do that.”


 At this, a flustered Cheol Su-ryeon tried to make her stand up, but she was immovable.


 “How can you do this? If you do this, I won’t be able to face that person. Please stand up.”


 “I can’t until Master Cheol Su-ryeon agrees to help.”


 “What?”


 At her words asking for help, Cheol Su-ryeon furrowed her brow.


 She had guessed there was some reason they had come to this hidden place, but she didn’t expect such an earnest attitude.


 “Young miss…”


 “My father, the last young sect leader, along with Mushang Fortress, the Blood Sect… even numerous martial arts sects were annihilated and sacrificed on the day of the great calamity.”


 “……”


 At these words from Jin Ye-rin, Cheol Su-ryeon’s expression froze.


 She had heard about the day of the great calamity from those who had intruded here.


 They had said that the level of the martial arts world had greatly declined since then.


 However, she never imagined this story would include Mushang Fortress and the Blood Sect.


 Even if they weren’t as great as during that person’s time, she thought Mushang Fortress and the Blood Sect would still be solid due to the descendants who had continued the lineage.


 ‘Aah.’


 Cheol Su-ryeon then looked up at the sky, which had cracks due to the damaged formation.


 ‘…Has that person’s concern become reality?’


 That person had said.


 Everything that exists will decay, and that would be no different for Mushang Fortress or the Blood Sect.


 Had it really come to pass?


 Even though it had been a long time since that person left, it was truly hard to believe.


 To her, who was feeling bitter, Jin Ye-rin continued speaking in an earnest voice.


 “On the day of the great calamity, numerous spiritual beasts and even spirit beasts went berserk and tried to destroy the human world. At that time, many heroes of the Central Plains, including my grandfather, came forward and sacrificed themselves to stop it.”


 “……”


 “However, this was not a natural occurrence. My father, the last young sect leader, discovered that it was caused by certain individuals. That organization is still intact and again…”


 -Swish!


 At that moment, before she could finish speaking, Cheol Su-ryeon raised her hand.


 Jin Ye-rin looked at her puzzled by her incomprehensible attitude.


 Then Cheol Su-ryeon,


 -Thud!


 Knelt on both knees like her, clasped her hands in a salute, and opened her mouth.


 “I apologize. I understand what you want to ask, young miss, but I cannot leave this place.”


 “What?”


 Jin Ye-rin, who hadn’t yet made any request, couldn’t hide her bewilderment.


 She had thought that if this woman, who had achieved great fame even in the old martial arts world and possessed martial arts surpassing the Seven Heavens called the pinnacle of the current martial arts world, helped them, they could more easily eliminate the enemies behind the scenes.


 But to be rejected before even making the request, she couldn’t help but feel deflated.


 Moreover, wasn’t she that person’s loyal servant?


 How could she reject so coldly without even listening to everything?


 “Master Cheol Su-ryeon.”


 “I have already received punishment from that person to guard this place and cleanse my karma.”


 “Cleanse your karma?”


 “Although all martial artists accumulate much karma, I killed numerous innocent women and children to save my blind eyes and this womb.”


 “……”


 At Wicked Granny Cheol Su-ryeon’s words, spoken calmly as if confessing, Jin Ye-rin was momentarily at a loss for words.


 Although she had heard old stories from her father, she didn’t properly know the specific reasons why she was called a great villain.


 However, unexpectedly, the karma she bore was incomparably stronger than ordinary people.


 Seeing her surprised look, Cheol Su-ryeon spoke in a bitter voice.


 “I was accumulating merit to cleanse my karma here, and I swore to that person on my life. That no matter what happened, I would not leave this place.”


 “Ah…”


 A sigh escaped Jin Ye-rin’s lips.


 She had thought this was an opportunity to gain not only the forbidden technique but also the best ally.


 But that expectation was crumbling so hopelessly.


 Then Wicked Granny Cheol Su-ryeon said to her, who couldn’t hide her disappointment.


 “However, the reason that person left me here was not just to cleanse my karma.”


 “What do you mean?”


 “Please follow me.”


 Wicked Granny Cheol Su-ryeon stood up and guided her towards the thatched house.


 As they entered the thatched house,


 ‘!?’


 Mok Gyeong-un was there alone.


 At this, Cheol Su-ryeon looked at the broken silver wood bars with wary eyes.


 Could it be that the vengeful spirit couldn’t endure in the end and was annihilated?


 If that was the case, she might have to fight this man again.


 But then,


 “Do you know about the forbidden technique?”


 Mok Gyeong-un wasn’t angry at all.


 Rather, he was extremely calm.


 Puzzled by this, Cheol Su-ryeon asked, hoping it might be the case.


 “…Where did that vengeful spirit go?”


 “That’s none of your business, old monster.”


 “You!”


 For a moment her voice almost rose, but Cheol Su-ryeon soon calmed her anger.


 There was no point in fighting this guy again; she would only be at a disadvantage.


 From the moment she took the vow not to kill, those with equal or greater power than her became enemies she couldn’t face.


 -Did you really defeat that old monster?


 Cheong-ryeong’s voice reached Mok Gyeong-un’s ears.


 Cheong-ryeong, whose spirit body had been damaged to the brink of annihilation while trapped in the silver wood, had voluntarily entered the wooden puppet to recover her spirit energy.


 Cheong-ryeong couldn’t hide her surprise seeing Wicked Granny somewhat overwhelmed in aura.


 To think she could do this even to a great villain of the old martial arts world, she wondered where the limit of this Mortal fellow was.


 Meanwhile, Jin Ye-rin, who was behind them, sighed and said.


 “Young Master Mok. I don’t know what happened, but if the misunderstanding is cleared up, please stop now.”


 At her words, Mok Gyeong-un lightly shrugged his shoulders.


 

  Then Cheol Su-ryeon glared at Mok Gyeong-un with a displeased expression, then brought a wooden box that had been in the corner of the thatched house and placed it on the table.


 At this, Jin Ye-rin asked in a puzzled voice.


 “What is this?”


 “It’s the arrangement that person left behind.”


 “That person left it?”


 “Yes. Please open it yourself.”


 As Cheol Su-ryeon urged, holding out her hand, Jin Ye-rin hesitated for a moment before opening the lid of the wooden box with a tense expression.


 -Click!


 When she opened it, there was an old wooden slip and a book inside.


 Jin Ye-rin’s eyes shook as she saw the writing on the cover of the book.
