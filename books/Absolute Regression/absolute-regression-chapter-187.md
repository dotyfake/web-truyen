# Absolute Regression Chapter 187 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Cheon So-hee gặp Ian, người tự xưng là cựu vệ sĩ của Nhị công tử (Duke of Yi), dưới ánh trăng. Ian tươi tắn và tự tin hơn trước, khen ngợi So-hee là "bàn tay sắt" của Đông Quyền Môn (Dongkwonmun). So-hee cảm thấy thoải mái khi Ian không hề có thái độ xem thường phụ nữ làm võ thuật. Geommu-geuk xuất hiện, và So-hee nhận ra Ian có tình cảm với anh.

Ian hỏi thăm Geommu-geuk về việc luyện tập võ thuật ở Đông Quyền Môn, điều mà ai cũng biết. So-hee ghen tị khi thấy sự tin tưởng sâu sắc giữa Ian và Geommu-geuk. Ian bất ngờ hỏi Geommu-geuk "đến rồi à?", rồi cả hai quyết định giao đấu. Geommu-geuk nói với So-hee rằng trận đấu này sẽ giúp ích cho cô, người sẽ trở thành Kwonma tiếp theo.

So-hee liên tục khóc, Geommu-geuk và Ian bắt đầu giao đấu. Ian lo lắng Geommu-geuk sẽ bị thương khi đánh tay không, nhưng sau vài chiêu, cô nhận ra anh quá nhanh và mạnh. Geommu-geuk áp đảo Ian, buộc cô phải dốc hết sức để phòng thủ. Cuối cùng, Ian tìm được sơ hở và phản công bằng Bicheongeom (Bicheongeom method), Jayshik transformation, khiến So-hee phải thốt lên kinh ngạc. Geommu-geuk né được đòn tấn công bằng Hắc Quyền (Black Fist technique).

So-hee chứng kiến trận đấu, cảm thấy xấu hổ và ngưỡng mộ hai người, quyết tâm phải mạnh hơn. Geommu-geuk khen ngợi Ian và mời cô đến tập luyện mỗi đêm. Anh muốn Bicheon kiếm thuật (Bicheon Sword Technique) đạt đến Cửu Thiên (nine castles). Ian ôm Geommu-geuk. Chứng kiến cảnh ấy, So-hee bật khóc vì cảm động. Cô xin Geommu-geuk dạy võ cho mình, bất chấp nguy cơ bị trách phạt vì câu nói "tử hình" (death penalty).

Geommu-geuk đồng ý, và Ian vui vẻ chào đón cô tham gia "khóa tu đêm khuya". Trong khi đó, Geommu-geuk vẫn tiếp tục luyện tập Hắc Quyền trong Hắc Uyên (Black Circle) với Kwonma, một cuộc chiến xem ai bỏ cuộc trước. Geommu-geuk tự tin rằng mình sẽ thắng vì anh luôn chuẩn bị kỹ lưỡng.

Vào buổi tối, Geommu-geuk dạy võ cho Ian và So-hee. So-hee lo lắng việc cô học võ quan trọng có thể gây phiền toái, nhưng Geommu-geuk trấn an cô rằng cô còn quan trọng hơn. Anh nói đùa rằng nếu cả ba không thành công, họ sẽ mở một quán mì trước cổng Võ Lâm Minh (Murim Alliance). Ian nói thêm rằng có lẽ Geommu-geuk muốn gặp một người phụ nữ ở đó.

Đến ngày thứ năm của khóa tu đêm khuya, Ian cuối cùng cũng tìm được cánh cửa dẫn đến Cửu Thiên. Geommu-geuk ôm chúc mừng cô. So-hee lại bật khóc, và Ian cũng khóc theo. So-hee xin Geommu-geuk tiếp tục dạy võ cho cô. Ian ủng hộ cô, và đúng lúc đó, Kwonma xuất hiện với khuôn mặt đáng sợ và hỏi "Ai cho phép ai tùy tiện xử tử người khác?".

So-hee hoảng sợ, lo lắng sẽ bị trục xuất khỏi Đông Quyền Môn. Nhưng Kwonma lại đưa ra một yêu cầu bất ngờ: xin được tham gia "khóa tu đêm khuya".

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-186/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-188/)Episode 187: Who is the one who decides to execute someone?




It was a woman in a pure white robe under the moonlight. With her noble beauty, she looked as if she had just descended from the sky.


Cheon So-hee wiped her tears away with her sleeve again. She was afraid that she was seeing things because of the sudden tears. However, the beautiful woman smiled brightly and introduced herself in front of her.


“Nice to meet you. My name is Ian. I’m your former bodyguard.”


Ian greeted her cheerfully. She was bright before, but she had become even brighter recently. Her actions were full of confidence.


“I am Cheon So-hee of the Dongkwonmun Black Fist.”


“Ah! It’s an honor to meet you.”


“Do you know me?”


“Of course. You are the best iron fist in the Dongkwonmun, aren’t you?”


Cheon So-hee felt good. It wasn’t just because she was being praised. Ian’s praise didn’t give her the feeling that a woman is doing martial arts? Something special? that she usually feels.


“What I said when I came in earlier was just a joke to tease you, Master, so please forgive me if I offended you in any way.”




“are you okay.”


“Then let’s talk. I’ll come back later.”


Ian, who was about to turn around after greeting, was stopped by Geommu-geuk.


“Since you’re here, why don’t we chat a bit before we go?”


Ian asked Cheon So-hee cautiously.


“may I?”


“Of course.”


Cheon So-hee became curious about this beautiful woman.


The two women’s feelings were quite contrasting. Ian had a beauty that gave off a noble air, while Cheon So-hee had a strength that made it seem like she would come back to life no matter where she was thrown.


“Don’t misunderstand. I’m not crying because of the engineer.”




“really?”


“yes?”


Ian asked again, his eyes sparkling.


“Aren’t you really crying because of the young master? I cry often because of the young master.”


Ian said, looking at the sword dance.


“You make me cry every time.”


With her womanly intuition, Cheon So-hee felt that she liked Geommu-geuk as a man.


“You said you were the escort of the Duke of Yi?”


“Yes, I have been kicked out now.”


“Why were you kicked out?”




“You said it was for my happiness, but that’s just an excuse, right?”


“That’s an excuse. Be careful. Flirts are good at talking.”


“You are the best speaker in the martial arts world.”


The swordsman smiled and spoke to the two.


“How long has it been since we last met and you’re already dead?”


The two women felt attracted to each other.


Ian originally liked a strong woman like Cheon So-hee. It was because he wanted to be that kind of person himself.


Cheon So-hee also had a good first impression of Ian. A woman this beautiful would have some kind of unlucky side that would make her difficult to approach, but there was nothing like that about her.


Ian asked the swordmaster.


“How is your training going?”


“That news has reached your ears, even though you have been locked up in the training hall and are only practicing. There must be no one in our school who does not know about it.”


“Yesterday, the kitchen maids were cooking while talking about how the master passed the exam. I heard that there were even people who made bets on whether he would become a disciple or not.”


It was a hot topic in the school that Geommugeuk was learning martial arts at Dongkwonmun.


Ian asked Geommugeuk with gentle eyes.


“How are you?”


“are you okay.”


Cheon So-hee watched Ian smile at Geommu-geuk’s answer. She felt a deep trust between the two of them, and for a moment, she felt envious. She didn’t have anyone like that, let alone someone who could imitate her.


“But what are you doing up so late at night?”


“While I was practicing, I suddenly wanted to see you, Master.”


The swordsman stared at her intently and then suddenly asked.




“Are you here?”


Ian nodded with a serious expression at the unknown question.


“I think it’s here.”


Then Geommugeuk jumped up from the rock and walked into the yard.


“Let’s play a round of martial arts.”


Ian looked at Cheon So-hee, bowed his head slightly, and walked out into the yard. It would have been rude to suddenly do something like that in this situation, but it was too important for her.


Cheon So-hee, who had figured out the mood, quickly got up from her seat.


“I’m going to go now.”


The sword dance stopped her from leaving.


“You can see it. No, look. This weapon will be of great help to Lady Cheon.”


It was a teaching of the sword dance given to the person who would become the next Kwonma.


“Is that okay?”


“I shed precious tears, but I have to earn the price of my tears.”


At the words “precious tears,” Cheon So-hee’s eyes became hot again.


‘Why is it like this?’

Suddenly, her tear ducts, which had been blocked, began to open, and she kept crying. She was flustered because it was her first time experiencing something like this, but fortunately, Geommu-geuk and Ian were facing each other and about to start a dance.


“I will fight you with martial arts.”


“yes!”


“No, Ian! Aren’t you worried that I’m fighting without a sword?”


“Don’t worry. Even if you were to fight me with both hands and feet missing, I wouldn’t be able to win.”


“That’s true. As long as you have this mouth.”


Cheon So-hee, who had been watching, nodded as if she slightly agreed.


The swordsman who had been standing behind her spoke to her.


“Don’t nod.”


Then Cheon So-hee nodded even more loudly. He was a person with eyes on the back of his head, so he was someone for whom having a sword or not was not an issue.


When the fight started, Ian couldn’t focus on the fight at first. He said he believed in the words, but he was worried that the swordsman might get hurt while fighting with his bare hands.


However, after exchanging a few moves, I concluded that there really was no such thing as this kind of wit. Even if Geommu-geuk was fast, it was too fast. Even if I were swinging ten swords right now, it seemed like I wouldn’t be able to touch even a single hair on Geommu-geuk.


‘Who really cares about whom!’


The sword dance was pushing her hard.


A punch with enough force to shatter her jaw flew into her face.


Another punch flew towards my side just as I was barely able to avoid it. This time, I twisted my body and barely avoided it. It was an attack that would have broken all my ribs if I had been hit.


Phew! Phew!


A sound as refreshing as the wind blowing from the sword could be heard every time the swordsman’s fist flew.


I tried to block and avoid it with great difficulty and somehow get away, but the sword dance followed me like a shadow. Once it approached, it was not easy to get away.


‘Ah, so this is how you die!’




Ian was having a new experience fighting a martial arts master.


Because he had not secured the distance, the power of his swordsmanship was not fully exerted. On the other hand, Geommu-geuk’s fist flew in without mercy, aiming for her vital point.


She barely managed to avoid it, giving it her all.


Ian thought that if he continued to avoid the attack, he would get hit, so he tried to counterattack somehow.


At the crucial moment, she found a loophole in the swordplay and used it to gain some distance.


‘Now!’


Only one chance!


Her sword wove the air. As the Bicheongeom method, Jayshik transformation, was activated, her sword underwent twelve transformations.


The exclamations that she had been holding back throughout the fight burst out of Cheon So-hee’s mouth.


“iced coffee!”


Geommugeuk avoided the attack that seemed absolutely unavoidable by using the Black Fist technique.


That method is that method?


She realized once again how great the martial arts she had learned were. She felt like her heart was going to burst as she watched. She wanted to jump in and fight along with them. She wanted to show off her skills just like the sword dance show.


That wasn’t the only effect this rain had on her.


A swordsman who seeks out Kwon Ma to learn martial arts despite being a disciple of the cult leader and possessing the skills of an absolute master.


Ian, who has the most beautiful appearance in the world, came here in the middle of the night to learn swordsmanship.


She felt a mixture of shame and respect, and the sight of these two people was engraved in her mind like a scene from a painting.


“Good job!”


The swordsman smiled brightly at Ian. He pushed her to the limit and gave her a chance to escape, but she didn’t miss it and found a way out. It was the result of her hard training.


“I still have a tingly feeling.”




The sword dance could tell that she was almost at the castle and was searching for the entrance.


“Come see me every night starting tomorrow.”


“Thank you, Young Master.”


Just as her father had forced her to become the Great Master of the Wind God Temple, Geommu-geuk intends to throw away her Bicheon Sword Technique into the nine castles. Once Bicheon Sword Technique has reached the nine castles, she will be able to put it anywhere with peace of mind.


When Geommu-geuk and Ian finished their conversation, Cheon So-hee spoke in a trembling voice.


“To be honest, the sword that the dwarf threw at me was so unrealistic that it wasn’t scary. But the sword that this unmanned man swung at night while everyone was asleep was scary.”


Can I defeat that sword that trains late into the night?


Among women of similar age, she was confident that she was the strongest in the martial arts world. However, after seeing the martial arts, she realized that it was nothing more than arrogance. She clenched her fists tightly, not wanting to lose.


It was a moment when fire was ignited in her heart as well.


Feeling the hot heat, Cheon So-hee suddenly spoke.


“Please teach me too. Death penalty.”


execution.


She will know.


If those words reached Kwon-ma, he would be in so much trouble. He had nothing to say even if he was excommunicated. It was a single word that he risked his life on. Death penalty.


Perhaps she would go back to her quarters and regret saying these words all night long.


That’s why Geommugeuk spoke to her warmly.


“Yeah, you come too. Buy it.”


Regrets later are just regrets, but now Cheon So-hee’s face was filled with joy.


Although it was understandable that he would feel a needless sense of rejection, feeling as if she were interfering with his training, Ian welcomed her cheerfully.


When people change, martial arts also change.




The sword dance was confident that Ian’s broad mind would lead her to the position of absolute master.


And Ian created a second gathering following the drinking party.


“Welcome to the late-night retreat.”


\* \* \*


Training in the Black Circle continued.


In the meantime, I was fighting with Kwon-ma. It was a fight to see who would raise the white flag first.


I was confident in this fight.


Anyway, my life was one where I had to prepare and prepare again.


You don’t have to learn Kwon Ma’s martial arts to advance to the next level. Kwon Ma’s martial arts are also part of the process of preparing everything at the same time.


You can learn Kwonma’s martial arts now, tomorrow, or in a year. Why? Because I had a lot to do, a lot to learn, and a lot of people to take care of. I was also endlessly preparing for other things. Do you think you can beat me like this?


Kwon-ma and I made eye contact every now and then. Every time, we talked through our eyes. Give up. You give up. I can go all the way. I can go too. I’m young. That’s why I can’t hold out.


You may think that training is boring and you will not be able to endure it in the end, but that is a mistake on Kwon Ma’s part. I am not an ordinary young man.


\* \* \*


At night, I taught Ian and Cheon So-hee.


On the first day of learning martial arts, Cheon So-hee asked me.


“Sir, is it okay for me to be by your side while you learn such important martial arts?”


Although he had earnestly asked me to teach with him that day, he seemed to have felt bad when it actually came to doing so.


I told her.


“You are more important than my martial arts. The current martial arts horse is my father’s martial arts horse and my brother’s martial arts horse. My martial arts horse is you.”


The future Cheonma and Kwonma.




A look of passion crossed her face. Then she asked the worst.


“Then what if I can’t be a Kwonma and Sahyung can’t be a Cheonma?”


“Then the three of us should open a noodle restaurant in front of the Murim Alliance and live there.”


Cheon So-hee laughed out loud, perhaps recalling the scene of her carrying the noodles from the empty kitchen to Lee Hyeong-hwan. It seemed like it was the first time she had laughed so brightly since meeting him.


“But why are you in front of the Murim Alliance?”


Ian answered instead.


“There might be a woman you want to see.”


“aha!”


Although he shouted no, the two of them were already nodding and starting to talk about the characteristics of a playboy.


On the fifth day of his late-night training, Ian finally found the door leading to the castle.


Her sword became faster and stronger, and underwent spectacular transformations.


There was no need for words of thanks or congratulations. Ian ran to me and hugged me tightly. I hugged her tightly. You worked hard, Ian. Now, there is only one more hurdle left until Daesung.


At that moment, Ian and I were startled by the sobbing sound and looked at Cheon So-hee.


She was crying.


“I think my tear ducts opened that day. I’ve never cried in my life, but I can’t stop crying.”


As she cried, Ian followed suit and shed tears.


“Why are you crying?”


“Because there are a thousand people crying.”


The two women turned their bodies away from each other and cried.


“Why are these strong women who can beat up any man in the world like this?”


Cheon So-hee said, wiping away tears.


“Death penalty, please continue teaching me.”


She was very sad that the late-night training was ending like this.


Ian stood up for her.


“Your Majesty, this late-night training session will continue.”


Just then, someone spoke coldly from behind.


“Who is executing someone at will?”


Cheon So-hee was startled and lost in thought.


A demon with a scary face entered the place where we were.


I greeted him with a calm face.


“welcome.”


Actually, I knew that Kwonma had been there. He had been there twice before. He had just watched me secretly, hiding his body, and then left. What on earth was he thinking as he watched?


Kwon Ma stood in the yard and glared at me, Ian, and Cheon So-hee.


In particular, Cheon So-hee was very surprised. Since Kwon Ma heard that it was a death sentence, there was no room for excuses. She lowered her head and trembled all over her body in fear that she might be kicked out of the Dongkwonmun. She probably hoped that the words “You are excommunicated” would not come out.


Kwon-ma uttered unimaginable words with that devilish face.


“Please include me in this late-night retreat.”
