# Absolute Regression Chapter 504 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Sau khi trở về, rất nhiều chuyện đã xảy ra. Jin Ha-gun kinh ngạc khi thấy Geommugeuk và Hyeolcheondoma (Bloodthirsty Demon) xuất hiện. Geommugeuk có vẻ lạnh lùng hơn bình thường, nhưng Jin Ha-gun nhận ra đó chính là ông. Anh cũng biết Hyeolcheondoma là thật, không phải ngụy trang. Anh nghi ngờ liệu Hyeolcheondoma có phải là người đã phá hủy Daejeongmun hay không.

Yoo Beom tự nhận mình là Jin Ha-gun, Chúa Tể Diệt Quỷ (Demon Destruction Lord). Jin Ha-gun chào Hyeolcheondoma, nhưng ông ta chỉ nhìn anh lạnh lùng, khiến các chiến binh của Chúa Quỷ (Demon King) trở nên lo lắng. Họ sợ Geommugeuk sẽ đứng về phía Hyeolcheondoma. Yoo Beom biết Geommugeuk không phải là người của Biệt Đội Diệt Quỷ (Demon Extermination Corps), nhưng là một giáo chủ trẻ tuổi.

Hyeolcheondoma nói với Geommugeuk rằng tốt hơn là không nên gặp ông ta thường xuyên, nhưng Geommugeuk không hề nao núng. Đại Kiếm Diệt Quỷ (Great Sword of Destruction) chĩa vào cổ Geommugeuk, nhưng anh chỉ nhớ lại lần đầu gặp Hyeolcheondoma, khi ông ta cũng chĩa kiếm vào mình. Geommugeuk mỉm cười và nói rằng anh rất vui vì ông ta vẫn an toàn. Anh lo lắng cho Hyeolcheondoma, tự hỏi liệu ông ta có bị tấn công hay bị bắt giữ ở đâu không. Anh cố ý nhắc đến cha mình để xem phản ứng của Hyeolcheondoma.

Geommugeuk lấy ra một tập thơ mà anh nhận được từ Seodaeryong và nói rằng những người yêu sách không phải là người xấu. Hyeolcheondoma chế nhạo, nhưng Geommugeuk quả quyết. Hyeolcheondoma cảnh báo rằng tin người như vậy sẽ bị phản bội và chết, nhưng Geommugeuk không quan tâm. Anh nói rằng Hyeolcheondoma đã cho anh quá nhiều đến mức anh sẵn sàng chết vì ông ta.

Hyeolcheondoma vung kiếm vào cổ Geommugeuk, nhưng anh né được. Anh nói rằng anh chỉ hơi lạnh nên trượt chân. Hyeolcheondoma cười khẩy. Yoo Beom yêu cầu Hyeolcheondoma giữ Geommugeuk lại để hắn có thể giết Jin Ha-gun, nhưng Hyeolcheondoma tát Yoo Beom bay vào góc.

Hyeolcheondoma nói rằng đây là ý của trường phái, chỉ có một người có thể ngăn cản nó. Geommugeuk nói với Hyeolcheondoma rằng nếu ai đó thao túng ông ta bằng sự cô đơn, anh sẽ sửa chữa; nếu ông ta có một đứa con bị bắt làm con tin, anh sẽ giải cứu; nếu ông ta chỉ đơn giản là chán đời, anh sẽ đến thăm mỗi ngày và làm cho nó vui vẻ.

Cuối cùng, Hyeolcheondoma lên tiếng theo cách quen thuộc của mình, mắng Geommugeuk là đồ ngốc. Anh thừa nhận rằng anh đã cố gắng trêu chọc Geommugeuk bằng cách tỏ ra lạnh lùng, nhưng anh đã bị ảnh hưởng bởi anh. Geommugeuk đáp lại bằng những lời khen ngợi, khiến Hyeolcheondoma mỉm cười.

Hyeolcheondoma quay sang Yoo Beom và nói rằng ông ta sẽ quay lại. Yoo Beom phản đối, nhưng Hyeolcheondoma nói rằng nếu hắn muốn hoàn thành nhiệm vụ, hắn có thể ở lại đó và chết. Hyeolcheondoma rời đi, để lại Yoo Beom và các chiến binh. Geommugeuk nói rằng anh sẽ làm việc của mình và sớm gặp lại ông ta.

Yoo Beom quyết định rời đi cùng Hyeolcheondoma. Hắn và các chiến binh rút lui về phía cánh cửa mà Hyeolcheondoma đã đi ra. Jin Ha-gun ra lệnh cho Biệt Đội Diệt Quỷ (Demon Squad) chiếm lấy ngôi làng. Anh cảm thấy không nên giết họ, có lẽ vì Geommugeuk đã để họ đi vì Hyeolcheondoma.

Geommugeuk bày tỏ lòng biết ơn với Jin Ha-gun vì đã cứu họ. Anh nói rằng ngay cả khi cẩn thận đến đâu, họ vẫn có thể rơi vào khủng hoảng. Anh tin rằng ngay cả khi không có anh, Thomas cũng sẽ không để Jin Ha-gun chết, vì anh là bạn của anh.

Jin Ha-gun nhận ra đây là khoảnh khắc mà anh thấy được sự kết thúc của niềm tin. Anh nghĩ rằng niềm tin của Geommugeuk vào Hyeolcheondoma còn lớn hơn gấp trăm lần so với mức cần thiết. Anh quyết định rằng anh sẽ thay đổi số phận của Hyeolcheondoma trong kiếp này.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-503/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-505/)504  

After returning, a lot has happened.




I’ve been surprised many times over the years, but have I ever been surprised like this?


‘No, sir, why are you coming out of there?’


If it were up to him, he would have started by making a fuss like this. But Geommugeuk didn’t say anything. He didn’t even say anything. He had to figure out what the situation was first.


‘Let’s calm down.’


The first thing that came into contact with me was the gaze of Geommugeuk and Hyeolcheondoma.


Although his gaze was colder than usual, he could tell that it was Geommugeuk.


‘He is a real old man.’


It’s not a fake disguised as a mask, nor is it a witchcraft. Even if you can fool everything else, you can’t fool those sharp eyes. Even if it wasn’t the eyes, the instinct of the swordsmanship told me. It must be the Bloodthirsty Demon.


Jin Ha-gun looked at Geommu-geuk. He knew enough about Geommu-geuk and the relationship with the Demon Lords.


I also know that the Bloodthirsty Horse cannot come out here.




‘Was the master who was going to kill us all the one you mentioned, Hyeolcheon Doma?’


He didn’t send his thoughts to the radio. He felt that Geommu-geuk was more surprised than he was. And with the appearance of the Bloodthirsty Demon, he naturally had one doubt.


‘Could it be that the one who destroyed Daejeongmun was Hyeoncheon Doma?’


In addition, something happened that further strengthened the suspicion. Yoo Beom pointed to himself and said this. It was as if he was saying that the person we had to kill was the author.


“The author is Jin Ha-gun, the Demon Destruction Lord.”


Even if I didn’t tell him, I knew him because I had met Hyeoncheon Doma before.


Jin Ha-gun calmly greeted Hyeoncheon Doma.


“It’s been a while.”


Bloodthirsty Horseman just looked at Jin Hagun with cold eyes and didn’t even say a word to him.


The Demon King’s warriors became nervous at that reaction. They had more numbers, but their opponent was the Demon King.




Moreover, the prayer of Yoo Beom, who had revealed his true colors, was not ordinary, and the unmanned people who were disguised as patients in the bed were not people to be ignored either.


And what they fear most of all is that the Sword Dance Theater will side with the Blood Heavenly Demon. This is because they know that his relationship with the Blood Heavenly Demon is as deep as his relationship with Jin Ha-gun. No, his arms will definitely bend inward.


If the Sword Dance Theater does not stand on their side, Jin Ha-gun will die here today.


The warriors of the Destruction Corps exchanged glances and glances. The determination to spare Jin Ha-gun at least, even if they all died, was shared among them.


This time, Yoo Beom looked at Geommu Geuk. He knew that Geommu Geuk was not a warrior of the Demon Extermination Corps, but a young cult leader.


“I didn’t know the little sect leader would come here with us. He saw through our plan.”


If it weren’t for the leader of the cult, the Demon Sect and Jin Ha-gun would have already fallen as cold corpses.


“Young leader.”


Bloodthirsty Demon walked towards the sword dance and said.


“I told you once. This old man has lived his whole life with bad luck, so it’s better not to see him often.”




Geommugeuk watched him approach in silence.


Jin Ha-gun watched the two people tensely, under a sense of terrible pressure.


Ugh.


The Great Sword of Destruction was aimed at Geommu-geuk’s neck. An aura flowed along the sharp blade, as if his neck would snap if he moved his hand.


A face was reflected on the road to destruction.


Geommugeuk looked at his own face reflected in the Taoist blade for a moment.


Suddenly, that day came to mind.


The day I first met the Blood Heavenly Sword after returning, that day too, he aimed the Heavenly Sword at my neck.


The gaze of the swordsman slowly moved along the blade of the sword. It passed the hand holding the sword and reached the face of the Bloodthirsty Demon.


Looking at that face, Geommugeuk smiled brightly.


“I’m so glad you’re safe.”


The corners of Hyeolcheondoma’s eyes twitched. His gaze was still cold.


There was a suffocating tension between the two of them, as if they were about to swing their swords and cut off each other’s heads at any moment.


But the sword dance was no different from how he usually treated him.


“I was very worried!”


Although he didn’t show it on the outside, he was worried about Hyeolcheon Doma. Could it be that he had been attacked by someone? Could it be that he was being held captive somewhere?


“But the person who knows you best is your father. He is not someone who will suffer anywhere, so you don’t have to worry about him. That’s what he said.”


I deliberately mentioned my father to see how the Bloodthirsty Horse would react. He showed no reaction.


“And sir, is it really possible to startle someone like this? When you opened the door and came in, my liver almost fell off!”


Even at this moment, Geommugeuk was talking a lot as usual.




On the other hand, the Bloodthirsty Horse reacted extremely coldly.


“Don’t you think I came here to kill you?”


One person was like the other, the other was unchanged, and so the conversation continued.


“Of course not.”


“Why?”


“You’re not that kind of person, sir.”


“What if I have been deceiving you until now? What if I am that kind of person?”


“That can’t be true.”


“How can you be so sure?”


“Because of this.”


Geommugeuk slowly reached into his pocket and took something out. It was a poetry collection he had received from Seodaeryong.


“There are no bad people among those who love books.”


“I might have fooled you by pretending to like books.”


“You liked books too much to say that.”


The bloodthirsty demon snickered openly.

“If you trust people like you, you will eventually be betrayed and die. That’s the world, that’s the martial arts world.”


A cold magical energy emanated from the body of the Bloodthirsty Demon. Not only Jin Ha-gun and the Demon Slayer Corps, but even Yoo Beom and his men were covered in goosebumps.


Only Geommu-geuk was looking at the Bloodthirsty Horse calmly without any disturbance.


“It’s okay, even if I’m betrayed by you.”


“Even though the result is death?”


“You have given me so much that I would die for it. If I could give you that much love, I would give you my life.”


Shhh.


The Heavenly Sword tried to cut off his neck, but Geommu-geuk twisted his body to avoid it. He didn’t really mean to kill him, he just wanted to cut his neck enough to make blood spurt out.


“Why are you avoiding it?”


“Did I dodge? It was a bit cold that day, so I fell a little.”


The bloodthirsty demon just made a face of laughter.


Yoo Beom asked Hyeolcheon Doma.


“I have to finish what I was doing. Please hold on to the little leader for a moment.”


He naturally believed that the Bloodthirsty Demon would follow his words.


As soon as those words were spoken, both sides moved simultaneously. The demon troop simultaneously blocked the front and sides of the Jinha Army. What had been feared had finally happened.


The men on the bed also stepped forward and drew their swords.


Yoo Beom had an expression of confidence as long as the leader of the cult did not come forward. And that confidence did not come from ability.


When Yoo Beom touches the device protruding from the bed right next to him.


Clank.


Behind Jin Ha-gun and the Myulma-dae, several small doors opened. From the holes inside them.




Shhhhh.


The smoke flowing out from there was the scent of the screaming herb. It was installed so that the scent of the screaming herb could also come out from the back in case it did not come towards the bed.


As the two scents combined, the flow of internal energy of Jin Ha-gun and the warriors of the Mystery Demon Corps was momentarily interrupted.


Yoo Beom’s order was given.


“Kill them all!”


At that very moment, when they were all about to fly towards the Demon Squad!


Geommugeuk drew his sword and aimed it at the empty space between them. It was a warning not to go towards the Myulma-dae.


“Just go!”


The warriors who took the lead under Yoo Beom’s command flew straight towards Jin Ha-gun and the Myulma-dae. They were confident that the Blood Heavenly Demon would stop the young cult leader.


Shhhhh!


Crunch!


A single ray of sword energy was emitted from the sword of the sword dance.


The unmanned soldiers in the lead fell down, their bodies cut to pieces by the sword. Those who followed behind all stopped.


The smell of blood rose up in the room and blood began to flow down the floor.


Yoo Beom looked at Hyeolcheon Doma with a surprised expression.


“Why didn’t you stop the young cult leader?”


Bloodthirsty Demon took the sword aimed at Geommu-geuk’s neck away and approached Yoo Beom.


Taaak!


Yoo Beom’s body, which had been hit in the cheek, flew to the corner and crashed. Fortunately, he did not lose his life because he had not been injected with internal energy.


Yoo Beom, who got up from his seat, glared at Hyeolcheon Doma. Although his martial arts skills were clearly far behind Hyeolcheon Doma’s, he confidently showed his anger.




Bloodthirsty Demon looked at him and spoke coldly.


“This is the will of the school. There is only one person who can stop it.”


No matter how special the circumstances, a cult leader is a cult leader.


It was just then.


From behind, Geommugeuk spoke to Hyeolcheondoma.


“If someone is manipulating you with loneliness, that’s fine. I’ll fix you. If you have a child you’ve been hiding and they’re being held hostage, I’ll definitely rescue them. If you’re just suddenly bored with life, that’s fine. From now on, I’ll visit you every day and make it fun.”


It was at that very moment that the thing that Geommu-geuk had been longing for since the beginning of this meeting happened.


The sound of the Bloodthirsty Horse came flying in. And it was in his usual way of speaking.


-My ears hurt, you punk!


This one sentence was enough. I knew it without having to explain it in detail. I was now on their side, helplessly. I was the same unchanging Bloodthirsty Horse.


-I knew it all!


-how?


―Because you will trust your father and me. No matter what unavoidable circumstances brought you here, you will trust that your father and I will solve it. Trusting someone is also intelligence, and you are the smartest and most discerning person in the world. You are the only book-reading lord in the world, right?


He couldn’t see the sword dance because his back was turned. Bloody Cheon Do Ma’s eyes softened at the compliment he heard after a long time.


– But you must have been surprised at my first appearance?


―You may say that you were trying to show them that you were drawing a line between us by pretending to be cold, but I know that. You were trying to tease me, right? You were trying to enjoy seeing me flustered and surprised. You were influenced by me. When the opportunity comes, you have to tease me somehow! It doesn’t work on me. Just tease your disciple!


A smile appeared on the corner of Hyeolcheondoma’s mouth. It was his original appearance.


But the momentary smile was short-lived, and when he turned his head to Yoo Beom, his expression was even colder.


“I’m going back!”


Yoo Beom was startled.




“The mission must be accomplished.”


“Then you stay here and die.”


Hyeolcheon Doma left Yoo Beom and Muin behind and walked towards the door he had come out from.


The sword dance sent its last sound.


-I’ll do my own thing. See you soon, sir!


As the blood clot disappeared, Yoo Beom looked at Jin Ha-gun in conflict.


There were still traps left in this space. This was because it was made as a tomb for Jin Ha-gun and the Demon King.


But there was a variable called Geommu-geuk. When he came with them, all the plans went awry. The fact that Hyeolcheon Doma left was ultimately because of this cult leader.


Yoo Beom’s worries didn’t last long. If he was going to go, he had to get out with Hyeolcheon Doma before he got too far.


“We’re going too!”


Yoo Beom and Muin drew their swords and retreated to the door through which Hyeolcheon Doma had exited.


The temporary effect of the poison had already disappeared, so the demon warriors of the Extermination Corps waited for Jin Ha-gun’s order to attack. Since the Blood Heavenly Demon had already left, if they attacked now, they might be able to annihilate them.


Jin Ha-gun felt instinctively that he should not kill them now.


If it was a situation where they had to kill each other, Geommugeuk would have killed them first. The reason Geommugeuk let them go was probably because of the Bloodthirsty Demon.


Despite this situation, Geommu-geuk left the decision up to him. Since they were trying to kill you and the Myulma-dae, he said he would follow your decision. If a fight broke out, Geommu-geuk would definitely help them.


Because he felt such consideration, Jin Ha-gun made the decision to do the sword dance.


“Just let it go.”


At Jin Ha-gun’s command, the Demon Squad took over the village. In the meantime, Yoo Beom and the warriors all escaped.


“Thank you.”


Geommugeuk expressed his gratitude to Jin Hagun.




“Thank you. If it weren’t for you, we would have all died already.”


Because I tried to carry the patients out without even knowing that they were the enemy.


Even if you are careful and careful again, you still end up in a crisis like this. It is not easy to deal with those who have only vicious murderous intent and malice instead of honor.


The demon troopers standing behind them all saluted Geommugeuk while waving their fists. It was a gesture of gratitude for the favor of saving their lives.


Although they didn’t fight a single person today, the Sword Dance Theater saw the true colors of the Demon Squad.


None of them showed any sign of discontent on their faces now. They might have been dissatisfied with having let those who had tried to kill them go.


Also, even if the opponent was the leader of the Demonic Cult, the favor was definitely given. This is why the elite are elite.


Geommugeuk said to Jin Hagun.


“Even if it weren’t for me, Thomas wouldn’t have let you die.”


Jin Ha-gun may find it hard to believe, but Geommu-geuk had a firm belief.


“If I hadn’t been there, Thomas would have done whatever it took to save you. That’s probably why Thomas is here today.”


“Why us, Thomas?”


Could that be possible? If I had to make up a reason, it would be because he is the next leader?


But that wasn’t what Geommugeuk was thinking.


“Because I know you are my friend.”


Jin Ha-gun knew what kind of moment this was.


This is the moment when you see the end of faith.


The Sword Dance Theater is now showing what it means to trust people.


‘You think we should trust only as much as we can afford to sell? You’re a liar.’


The faith of Geommu-geuk in the Bloodthirsty Demon seemed to be ten, no, even a hundred times more than was enough. That arm was an arm that could defeat a hundred.


“Okay, let’s go out too.”


The Geommu Theater took the lead and came out first.


I don’t think there is anything in this world that can tie up the Bloodthirsty Goat except for a father.


But are you still entangled in something? There must be a reason why you have to help the enemy even though you don’t want to.


His life before his return is unknown, as he was the first of the Majons to die.


‘In this life, I will change that destiny.’
