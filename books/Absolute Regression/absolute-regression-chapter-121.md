## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Ian và nhân vật chính tiếp tục hành trình đến nhà Gwimun, gia tộc của một quý tộc. Cả hai thong thả tận hưởng chuyến đi trước hôn lễ. Trên đường đi, họ gặp gỡ nhiều người khác nhau, từ kẻ dâm dục, người trọng nghĩa đến ông già giàu có. Nhân vật chính ghi lại những trải nghiệm này, vừa ngắm cảnh đẹp và thưởng thức ẩm thực địa phương.

Trong khi đó, Ian lo lắng về việc Đại Công tước (Archduke) có thể đang cố gắng lôi kéo các Lãnh chúa Quỷ (Demon Lords) về phe mình, và Quỷ Khát Máu (Bloodthirsty Demon) có thể liên minh với Đại Công tước. Nhân vật chính trấn an Ian, nói rằng việc có được sự ủng hộ của các Lãnh chúa Quỷ không quan trọng bằng việc "cho cá ăn" – trân trọng những người đã giúp đỡ mình từ đầu.

Họ không quên luyện tập võ thuật. Nhân vật chính nghiền ngẫm những lời dạy của đại sư Mansajongju, kết hợp với Thập Nhị Đại Tinh của Bích Thiên Kiếm Pháp (Twelve Great Stars of the Bicheon Sword Technique). Ian cũng đạt đến giai đoạn cuối của Bát Tinh Bích Thiên Kiếm Pháp (Eight Stars of the Bicheon Sword Technique) sau khi khai mở Nhâm Đốc Nhị Mạch (Imdokyang vein).

Trong một buổi luyện tập, Ian rơi xuống vực nhưng đã tự mình thoát hiểm. Nhân vật chính khen ngợi Ian và cả hai đã có một trận đấu kiếm trên không trung. Sau khi Nhâm Đốc Nhị Mạch được khai thông, chân khí (Jin-gi) và sức mạnh của Triều Tức (Chosik) của Ian đã thay đổi.

Nhân vật chính tiết lộ rằng họ đang trên đường đến dự một đám cưới, nhưng anh đã nhận được yêu cầu ngăn chặn nó từ một người đã giúp đỡ anh rất nhiều. Anh dự định sẽ gặp lại người này và đưa ra quyết định cuối cùng, nhưng nếu có thể, anh sẽ cố gắng ngăn cản cuộc hôn nhân. Anh cũng muốn gặp Letterweight, người bạn duy nhất của anh khi còn là lãng nhân, người đã cho anh biết về Đại Pháp Hoàn Hồn (Great Law of Return).

Tại Quỷ Môn Trang (ghost town) vào đêm khuya, Xu Kong, người thừa kế của gia tộc Gui, bận rộn nghiên cứu Đại Pháp Hoàn Hồn. Em trai của anh, Seojin, mang đến những tài liệu đã được thu thập. Seojin bày tỏ sự mệt mỏi và nghi ngờ về khả năng thực hiện Đại Pháp Hoàn Hồn, cho rằng việc này sẽ chỉ khiến thế hệ sau tiếp tục bị giam cầm trong phòng thí nghiệm. Cô thúc giục anh trai hãy sống cuộc sống mà anh muốn nếu thực sự có thể quay về quá khứ.

Người hầu báo tin vui rằng người mà Xu Kong chờ đợi sẽ đến vào ngày mai.

Trong một quán trọ ở Quỷ Môn Trang, Ian và nhân vật chính nghe thấy những vị khách khác bàn tán về đám cưới giữa gia tộc Gwimun và Imsi Geommun (Imsi Sword). Họ ngạc nhiên khi biết rằng tiểu thư Im (Lady Im) đã thuyết phục cha mình chấp thuận cuộc hôn nhân.

Trên đường phố, nhân vật chính nhìn thấy Xu Kong đang chờ đợi ai đó. Một nhóm người đi ngựa xuất hiện, dẫn đầu bởi một người phụ nữ. Xu Kong chạy đến chào đón cô, gọi cô là "Tiểu thư Im (Miss Im)!" Anh bày tỏ lòng biết ơn vì cô đã chấp nhận lời cầu hôn của anh, hứa sẽ làm cô hạnh phúc và thay đổi ý định của cha cô. Nhân vật chính kinh ngạc trước cảnh tượng này, tự hỏi tại sao Xu Kong lại yêu vợ mình đến vậy.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-120/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-122/)Episode 121 How easy it is to forget.




Ian and I continued our journey.


The destination was Gwimun, the family of the nobleman. Since there was still some time left until the wedding, Ian and I were enjoying our trip according to schedule.


In the process, she met many people. She met a lustful man who was after her, and a simple Confucius who loved her so much that he would sacrifice his life for her. A rich old man came to her with gold and proposed to her. The lustful man died, the Confucius cried, and the old man was humiliated.


Meeting different people was a new and good experience, but unexpectedly, what she liked more was seeing the beautiful scenery and eating the delicious local cuisine. People may be noisy, but everything she saw in the Central Plains for the first time must have been new.


She tried to remember the moment as if she would never come back again. She even wrote down the events of her trip.


“This dish is really delicious. Your Majesty, you should try it too.”


“I like this better.”


“That’s too spicy. If you like spicy food too much, you’ll get sick of it.”


“You won’t be able to survive in Sacheon.”


“Still, I want to try some real Sichuan cuisine.”




Now she was completely oblivious to the gazes of those around her. People still glanced at her beauty, but since we didn’t care, they disappeared.


“But, Master. Can we play like this?”


“Why not?”


“The Archduke is probably trying to get the Demon Lords to his side right now.”


“I guess so.”


“What if Bloodthirsty Demon joins hands with the Archduke again?”


“Please, tell them to do that. How much fun would it be to bring them back?”


“You are so carefree that I feel uneasy.”


“Don’t be anxious. If I’m destined to be the successor, I can go back slowly, but if I’m not destined to be, I won’t have to meet the Demon Lords every day. And right now, I’m doing something much more important than getting the Demon Lords on my side.”


“What’s going on?”




“Feed the fish you catch.”


She pointed at herself and I nodded.


How many mistakes do you make? How easily do you forget that if it weren’t for the fish you caught first, you wouldn’t even have a chance to catch a new one. How do you take human kindness for granted? How can you compare it to the gratitude of being caught first and staying with you?


She said with a smile.


“I’ve been eating a lot of fish these days.”


“So you shouldn’t complain later! Saying that I lacked affection or faith!”


“In that sense, please give me just one more!”


“Order everything next to it too!”


Of course, we didn’t neglect our martial arts training while traveling.


Running, jumping, and dancing. Except for the time spent eating and enjoying the beautiful scenery, I devoted all my time to practicing martial arts.




Especially these days, whenever I have time, I am pondering the essence of the teachings of the great master, Mansajongju.


That realization, combined with the Twelve Great Stars of the Bicheon Sword Technique, tickled me. Knowing that this tickling always leads to growth, I never neglected my martial arts training for even a moment.


Ian, as Ian, devoted himself to martial arts training. In particular, with the opening of the Imdokyang vein, she had reached the final stage of the Eight Stars of the Bicheon Sword Technique. Now, if she just worked a little harder, she would be able to reach the formation.


Lightness training is an essential part of swordsmanship training.


“Ahhhhhhh!”


Ian, who fell from the cliff, was still screaming, but his movements were different than before. His limbs that had been flailing around were moving calmly.


At the last moment, she twisted her body several times and landed on the ground. She stumbled and fell forward, but managed to get off the cliff on her own.


“I did it!”


She was so happy that she jumped for joy.


I followed her down and got down next to her. At the last moment, she was surprised when I walked down the air as if I was coming down an invisible staircase.


“I jumped so much like you that I gained some weight too.”


“How can you be so intimidating to someone? I came down here after causing a fuss, and this is what you’re doing!”


“I’m human too, so I want to show off and show off, right?”


“You’re already good enough even if you don’t show off.”


“Ah, I want to keep showing off and keep hearing this.”


“Do it, I will do it without getting tired.”


Although she is so devoted to me, she is also a playful, cheerful, bright, intelligent person who values her personal life and happiness. That is why I appreciate and like her even more.


Ian drew his sword.


“Okay, you should give me a compliment. Please do me a favor.”


I had a huge fight with her.




I fought while flying up the cliff with light air. Sword energy flew from the air, and I avoided the sword energy and flew up by kicking off the cliff.


She felt on the brink of death several times. She fell off a cliff and climbed back up, and then a sword energy flew at her. She narrowly avoided the sword energy and unleashed her own sword energy, and had to climb up the cliff.


It was a real fight between masters. I set up the board and guided her, but she handled it well. I can feel her skills improving. I also felt things while teaching her.


So we ended the fight when we got back on the cliff.


“After the Imdokyangmaek was opened, the movement of Jin-gi and the power of Chosik changed.”


“You know this moment is important, right?”


“I know.”


Her eyes are filled with determination. The scenery is beautiful, the food is delicious, but she is also a natural born martial artist. Nothing can compare to the joy of the moment when martial arts grow.


“You are doing well.”


“Who is the master that can’t do it?”


Her eyes turned towards me, filled with gratitude and respect.


“You said you wanted to see the wedding, right? If you go over that mountain, that’s where we were going.”


“But why are you hesitating whether or not to stop the wedding?”


“I was asked to do a favor. Please stop the wedding.”


“Who is it?”

“Yes. There is someone who helped me a lot.”


Although I could explain everything else, this was a difficult part to explain.


In fact, I told him harshly that he should get married and start living a hellish life again, but I felt bad for him.


If it weren’t for the spirits, I wouldn’t have been able to return. I understand why you betrayed me and tried to leave.


A chance to go back to the past, how could a human being escape that temptation? Perhaps the reason he wanted to go back, even if it meant betraying me, was not to avoid that marriage?


I’ll have to meet him to make the final decision, but if possible, I’ll try to discourage the marriage. Since he was so desperate.


“Are you a man who likes married women?”


“I don’t think so?”


There will be no enemy like that. The spirit described married life as hell.


“Even if it’s not a wedding, there are people I want to see.”


letterweight.


My only friend during my time as a ronin. If she, the younger sister of the spirit master, hadn’t told me about the Great Law of Return, I would never have known about it.


“Okay, let’s go for now.”


I threw myself off the cliff. I heard Ian’s shout from behind.


“I’m the type of person who’s afraid of heights! You shouldn’t just go like that!”


But contrary to what he said, Ian didn’t hesitate and followed me with his body.


\* \* \*


The night of the ghost town was deep.


After becoming the successor of the Gui family, Xu Kong became so busy that he barely had time to sleep.


During the day, he had to learn the non-returning technique that was only passed down to the successors of the ghost family, and at night, he had to study the great method of return. It was a long-cherished wish of the family for a long time, and the materials passed down from generation to generation alone exceeded thousands of volumes.




He was reading a book until late again today.


Then a familiar voice was heard from behind.


“If I had studied swordsmanship with this sincerity, I would have become the best swordsman in the world.”


The nobleman answered, still looking at the book.


“If you had learned swordsmanship during this time of meddling, you would have become the best.”


The person who entered the room was his younger brother, Seojin.


“If you push yourself too hard, you’ll get sick. If you collapse, it’ll all come back to me.”


“Don’t worry. I made a promise with the ghost. He won’t arrest me until this research is finished.”


“The ghost I met didn’t say things like that?”


Only then did the spirit look up from his book and look at her.


“Oh my, my brother already has an ugly face, and he looks even uglier when he’s tired.”


“Isn’t that okay for someone like me?”


“Only a mirror can accept such an illusion, brother.”


The ghost laughed out loud. In the midst of his daily routine, the only person who gave him some breathing room was his younger brother.


Seojin placed the book he brought on the desk.


“Here. I’ve cleaned up everything you asked me to clean up.”


“Good job.”


“You’ve worked hard. I’m not a genius like you, Uncle. I have to see Uncle five times instead of once. What’s so unnecessarily difficult? It’s really hard.”


“I know, I know.”


The nobleman felt sorry for his younger brother. He was spending his prime youth only on research.




She was not only good-looking, but also had a refreshing personality. She was popular when she went out, but these days, she just stays locked up in the lab.


Seojin brought up a story she had never brought up before.


“Brother, do you really believe that the Law of Return is possible?”


“Believe.”


The nobleman answered without hesitation.


“Even though it goes against the natural order?”


“Still, I believe.”


Why doesn’t the spirit know why his younger brother is asking such questions?


“Are you tired?”


“It’s frustrating. If we continue to research like this and pass it on to our children… … Our children will also be locked in this lab for the rest of their lives, right?”


“I will definitely succeed in my generation.”


“If you can do it, please do it before I get any older. If not… … .”


The spirit felt that his younger brother was almost at his limit. Originally, his younger brother had an active personality. Although he had no choice but to follow his father’s orders, he did not know how long he would be able to endure it.


Seojin, who was about to turn around and leave, stopped in front of the door.


“Okay, let’s say that the method of regression is possible, just like Uncle said. So? What if you go back to the past? What will Uncle do when you go back to the past? Will you stay locked up and do research? Since you’ve achieved regression, will you do research on reincarnation?”


“!”


“If you think of something else instead… … Brother, aren’t we living the wrong life? We have to live doing that now, right? We have to go back and live the life we want to live, right?”


The nobleman was speechless.


Although he had a lot to say, Seojin did not press his brother any further.


“Go to bed early. Your face is really hurt.”




As she left the lab, the spirit sighed and leaned back in his chair.


My brother is right. If I live my life faithfully now, there will be no reason to go back. However, achieving the Great Law of Return was the family’s long-cherished wish. It was a fate I could not avoid once I became the successor.


Then the servant came and told me some good news. The person I had been waiting for so long would be arriving here tomorrow.


\* \* \*


The place Ian and I arrived was an inn in a village with a ghost town.


Ian had his mask fastened around his waist and was wearing a cotton turban, leaving only his eyes exposed.


After finding a room with two beds, we ordered a meal.


When the two of them traveled and stayed at guesthouses, they stayed in one room like this. Even though she told him to sleep separately because it was uncomfortable, Ian actually liked it. Her reason was that it was fun to talk about this and that before falling asleep.


So I was having a meal with Ian on the first floor of the guest house.


The guests around were talking about the wedding news of the ghost …


“I didn’t know that Gwimun would become in-laws with Imsi Geommun.”


“I’m surprised too. Hasn’t the Im clan swordsmanship been related to the swordsmanship family for generations?”


“They say that Lady Im persuaded her father.”


“It’s a combination of a ghost story and a sword story, so it can’t help but be interesting.”


“Oh, isn’t that the successor to the ghost family?”


Ian and I followed them outward.


A man appeared on the roadside. When I saw him, my heart was stirred. He was the ghost of my youth. I had seen him since middle age, and his face was still there.


‘Nice to meet you, my lord.’


Before my return, I had only had a few brief encounters with him, but at the most important moments, I had met him over the course of decades. I could not help but think of the hardships I had endured in the past when I had been collecting Dafa materials.


The ghost was looking across the street as if waiting for someone.




After a while, five or six people arrived on horseback. When the woman in the lead got off her horse, those following her also got off. It seemed that they were the warriors who were assisting the woman.


The spirit ran towards her.


“Miss Im!”


She was none other than Lim Hyang, the fiancee of the spirit.


“Confucius? Why are you here?”


“I heard that you were coming, so I came out to meet you.”


Honey dripped from the eyes of the spirit looking at her.


“Thank you for accepting my proposal this time.”


“It was a decision I made because I trusted Confucius.”


“What about your father?”


“You gave me permission, but… I think I still need some more time.”


“I will definitely change my father’s mind.”


The nobleman spoke loudly, not caring about the gazes of those around him.


“I will make you happy even if I have to sacrifice my entire body. No one can stop my feelings for you.”


I was watching the scene in astonishment.


‘What’s wrong with you? You used to love your wife this much?’
