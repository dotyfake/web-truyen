# Absolute Regression Chapter 450 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Sau khi Lim Gye-gi rời đi, nhân vật chính (tôi) lo lắng tìm cách thuyết phục cha giúp đỡ anh ta. Nhưng trước khi kịp mở lời, cha đã viết một bức thư và bảo Hui đưa nó cùng với một gốc nhân sâm trăm năm tuổi (Baeknyeonseolginseng) cho người đứng đầu Jidan. Cậu cảm thấy vô cùng cảm động trước hành động này của cha.

Trên đường đi, cha nói rằng chính những người như Lim Gye-gi đã giúp đỡ môn phái của họ tồn tại. Cha đề nghị sẽ cùng cậu tham gia một cuộc thi câu cá khi trở về, sử dụng chính những chiếc cần câu mà cậu đã làm. Cậu đồng ý và nhận thấy quyết tâm chiến thắng của cha.

Xe dừng lại, cậu mời cha đi dạo trong rừng để ngắm thác nước. Cha cậu im lặng ngắm cảnh, có vẻ rất thoải mái. Cậu hỏi cha về mối quan hệ của ông với ông nội, cha cậu trả lời rằng ông có nhiều điều để học hỏi từ cha mình khi ông còn là một người con. Cha cậu nói một câu khiến cậu bất ngờ: "Đôi khi ta hối hận vì đã gặp con," nhưng cậu hiểu rằng cha cậu chỉ muốn nói rằng cậu đang làm rất tốt.

Sau đó, cha cậu yêu cầu dừng xe để truyền dạy Cửu Thủ Ma Công (Nine-Handed Magic). Hui nhanh chóng rời đi để canh gác từ xa. Cậu đã luyện đến thức thứ năm, nhưng vẫn chưa ổn định. Cậu thi triển Cửu Hoa Ma Công (Nine Flower Demonic Ceremony) từ thức thứ nhất đến thức thứ tư trước mặt cha. Cha cậu nhận thấy sự khác biệt giữa Cửu Hoa Ma Công của ông và của cậu, không chỉ ở hình dáng mà còn ở cách chúng xuất hiện và biến mất. Cha cậu giảng giải về thức thứ năm (Jeo-o-shik), nhấn mạnh tầm quan trọng của độ chính xác để tiêu diệt kẻ thù khi bạn và thù lẫn lộn.

Cậu thi triển lại Jeo-o-shik, nhưng độ chính xác vẫn còn thấp. Cha cậu tiếp tục giảng giải, dễ hiểu và cụ thể hơn trước. Cậu nhận ra cha mình cũng đã mạnh hơn rất nhiều so với khi mới trùng sinh. Cha cậu đưa ra một thử thách khó khăn hơn: có con tin và năm kẻ địch bao quanh, cậu phải cứu con tin. Cậu thi triển Jeo-o-shik, nhưng lại vô tình giết chết con tin. Dù vậy, cha cậu vẫn khen ngợi cậu đã tiến bộ hơn trước.

Cuối cùng, họ đến một thị trấn. Ở đó có một quán trọ với một chủ quán rất tài giỏi mà cha cậu muốn ghé thăm.

Ở một diễn biến khác, Châu Hương Nguyệt (Zhou Xiangyue) liên tục gặp ác mộng vì áp lực của cuộc gặp gỡ sắp tới. Cô quyết định mặc võ phục thay vì những bộ quần áo lộng lẫy mà người hầu đưa cho. Mẹ cô, Lâm Tố Hòa (Lim So-hwa), xuất hiện và yêu cầu cô mặc những bộ quần áo đó, giải thích tầm quan trọng của cuộc gặp gỡ với Hoàng tử Hoàng (Prince Huang). Châu Hương Nguyệt biết rằng mẹ cô muốn lợi dụng tình cảm của Hoàng tử Hoàng để cứu vãn gia tộc đang suy tàn.

Khi đến quán trọ, Châu Hương Nguyệt chứng kiến một cuộc tranh cãi giữa những người của Hoàng Đô Thương Hội (Hwangdo Trading Company) và một thanh niên lạ mặt đang cố gắng xông vào.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-449/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-451/)The 450  

carriages were running towards their destination.




My father spoke to me with his eyes tightly shut.


“Why are you looking at me like that?”


How can you sense people’s gaze so well even with your eyes closed?


“I like it.”


My father opened his eyes slightly and looked at me.


“I’m not joking. I’m not kidding. I love my dad so much.”


“By sending a gift to that person?”


“No, please write a letter to him.”


To my father, a root of 100-year-old ginseng is just a small change.


But the letter my father wrote himself cannot be valued in money.




What really impressed my father was that I didn’t ask him to send the gift.


After Lim Gye-gi left, I wondered how I could persuade my father to help him. But before I could say anything, my father wrote a letter and gave it to Hui, saying:


‘Let the master of Jidan personally deliver it along with a root of Baeknyeonseolginseng.’


How could I not be moved?


“You are the best, Father.”


My father remained silent, his eyes closed, and said nothing.


It’s better if you don’t even show off!


And I could feel it.


At this moment, when his son called him the best, the father was clearly delighted.


Now, there is a corner of my father’s mouth that only I can recognize. That slightly raised corner of his mouth is proof that he is genuinely in love.




Then my father suddenly said.


“It is because of those people that our school has been able to survive.”


Yes, my father also has his own magic.


I hope that my father’s heart was conveyed to them. I hope that Lim Ji-eui’s father also becomes the best father like my father is now.


I stuck my head out the window. Was it because the wind was refreshing? The sky was even bluer and clearer.


“The weather is really nice.”


I glanced back and saw my father looking at the sky through the window on the other side.


Father, how are you? Does the sky you see here feel different from the sky you see in Cheonmajeon?


As the carriage, which had been running along the river, moved completely away from the river, my father suddenly spoke.


“When you come back, let’s have another fishing competition in that river. This time, we’ll both use the rods you made.”




I laughed out loud. I guess he wants to win at least in fishing. But I can’t lose to him. How could I lose on purpose when my father is watching me? If I did, he would get really angry.


“Okay. It’s always three games.”


A determination formed on the corner of Father’s mouth. It was a determination to win.


\* \* \*


“Mister Whee, please stop here for a moment.”


When the running carriage stopped, he said to his father.


“Would you like to take a walk?”


My father got out of the carriage without saying a word.


“There’s a beautiful waterfall if you go through the forest over there. Since you’re passing by, why don’t you take a look?”


Whi waited to guard the carriage and walked into the forest with his father.


“When was the last time you were here?”


“I discovered it by chance a while ago.”


This is a place I’ve been before returning. I remember walking down this road. I used to walk alone on the snow-covered road… Now, I’m walking down the road with my father, listening to the birds chirping, covered in green.


My father just walked without saying a word, but his expression as he looked around seemed comfortable. I walked along with him, quietly contemplating. The more time I spent with my father, the more the silence became less awkward.


At the end of that beautiful forest path is a waterfall. The waterfall pouring down like silver threads cooled the hearts of those who saw it.


Swaaaaaaah.


My father looked at the waterfall in silence. When was the last time he came out of school and saw the waterfall? It must have been a long time ago.


“Good.”


I could tell from those words that my father was truly satisfied.


“father.”




“Why are you doing that?”


“How was it with your grandfather?”


My father looked at me, as if it was a sudden question.


“I was curious about what kind of person my father was as a son.”


Father’s gaze turned back to the waterfall.


“I think there is a lot to learn from my father who was my son.”


I don’t know much about how my father got along with my grandfather.


My father, who had been silent for a long time, suddenly spoke.


“There are times when I regret seeing you.”


I looked at my father. He didn’t explain what he meant, but I knew he meant that I was doing well.


We stared at the waterfall in silence for a while and then walked back the way we came.


So I stopped the carriage once, and after riding for about half a day, this time my father stopped the carriage.


“If there’s a quiet place, stop for a moment.”


Whiga parked his carriage in a deserted place.


“Get down.”

I got out of the carriage with my father. Another thing I had been looking forward to on this trip came out of my father’s mouth.


“How far have you mastered the Nine-Handed Magic?”


He said that he would pass down the teachings of the Nine-Handed Demon. I was so happy that I felt like I was flying.


Because one word from my father will be of greater help than practicing for a hundred days.


As soon as the story of the Nine-Haired Demon Sect came up, the quick-witted Hwi disappeared into hiding. Since he had to stay away when teaching the Nine-Haired Demon Sect, he went to stand guard from a distance.


“I have mastered the fifth method, but the fifth method is still unstable.”


“Spread out the food as well.”


I performed the Nine Flower Demonic Ceremony consecutively from the first meal to the fourth meal in front of my father.


A flash of light flashed in my father’s eyes as he watched.


I didn’t expect that my training through the Shicheon Secret Art would have become this deep. At times like this, I’m so glad that I have the Heavenly Martial Arts Body. The Heavenly Martial Arts Body will explain the incomprehensibly fast achievements on my behalf.


But what my father noticed wasn’t just the depth of my accomplishments.


What I noticed more was that it was different.


My father’s Guhwa Magic Art and my Guhwa Magic Art are different.


Just look at the demons. They were completely different from my father’s. Not only in appearance, but also in the way they appeared and disappeared.


Of course, that doesn’t mean I can guarantee that my demons are stronger than my father’s.


This difference was maintaining the tension between my father and me. It was probably the driving force that led my already accomplished father back to the training ground.


“There are times when you have to use the Jeo-o-shik even though your internal energy is greatly consumed. Do you know when that time is?”


“I think it’s when friend and foe are mixed.”


Father nodded.


“Yes, that’s right. It’s time to pick out the enemies and kill them. That’s why my accuracy is vital.”




Because the accuracy of the Geo-o-shiki was low, it was like a disaster falling from the sky.


“Now, unfold it and take a look.”


I drew my black magic sword and stepped forward.


“Assume that the enemy is lined up every five paces from a point thirty paces away.”


I thought of the enemy as my father had said.


There were ten masters lined up in front of me.


‘Kill them all with just one move!’


After calming down for a moment, he performed the Jeo-o-sik Jeol-hon-ma-gyeok.


Shhh shhh shhh shhh shhh shhh shhh!


Pak pak pak pak pak pak pak pak!


It fell roughly in the spot I had in mind, but it wasn’t exact.


My father could clearly see the results even from a distance.


“The accuracy is still low and the depth is not consistent. The sixth and eighth are shallow, and the second and third are too deep.”


Even if you look closely, there is only a black hole on the ground, but my father accurately guessed it from afar. Even though ten black energies fell at the same time in an instant, he could tell the difference between them one by one.


My father gave a lecture on the Jeo-o-sik.


In the field of Kumkumagong, my father’s lectures gave me absolute enlightenment and learning.


My father’s teachings were specific.


I know better than anyone else how difficult the Guhwamagong is to master.


But my father’s explanation was easy. It was a specific and easy explanation that only someone who has reached a state of enlightenment can give.


Only a true expert can explain it easily.




My father proved this eternal truth to me.


Of course, there was a profound ignorance hidden in that ease. Those who do not know that ease will rather doubt it. Is this all? Is it this easy? In the end, to him, ease is just a passing cloud.


My father explained it simply and specifically, and I asked specific questions.


Whenever I had a question, I asked. I asked and answered.


That’s our realm.


“Now, unfold it again!”


This time too, my father designated the place where I should fall.


Ten more swords falling vertically.


“It’s better than before, but it’s still a long way to go.”


Father explained again.


It was not a training that gave you something to chew on and realize and made you think about it. You do that kind of deep thinking yourself, and what I teach you is only the specific parts!


It was as if the training now was being done by an unseen master teaching a student.


It was different from when you taught me before. It was easier and more specific.


That’s why I could know.


‘In the meantime, my father also grew up.’


Maybe it’s because I’ve grown up. My father is definitely stronger now than when he first regressed.


“Now, unfold it again.”


This time, my father walked to a place where the darkness was completely gone.


He looked at me from there and asked.


“There are hostages here. There are five enemies in total.”




Their father blew a gust of wind to indicate their location.


The hostages and the enemies were almost stuck together.


“Now, save him.”


“I thought my father would be standing in that hostage’s place.”


“Why me?”


“Isn’t that how it usually is? I trust you. That’s why I’ll take the hostage position. If you make a mistake, I’ll die.”


My father spoke firmly.


“How can I trust you?”


Then, he actually took a few more steps away.


I laughed because I knew it wasn’t a joke, it was serious.


I calmed my mind and thought about the situation. Those surrounding me were not just random people. They were real experts surrounding the hostage.


Swords aimed at the neck.


There is only one chance.


Swish swish swish swish swish!


Pfft pfft pfft pfft pfft!


And then my father told me the result.


“All enemies are dead.”


Just when I was about to cheer!


“The hostage is dead too.”


I ran to where the hostage was standing. As my father had said, there was a black energy falling there too. There were six lines instead of five. It was a mistake made because I was not yet used to controlling the number of black energy.




He looked down at the hole where the hostages had been and mourned.


“Daeryong, I’m sorry.”


I smiled as I recalled Seo Dae-ryong asking, “Why are you doing this?” But I can’t kill Ian, right? You have the left-handed general, right? I’m your right-hand man! Seo Dae-ryong’s voice came to mind.


“Still, it’s better than before.”


Just as I felt, my father also felt that things were different from when he was learning the art of the Nine-Handed Sword. We were growing together.


“Yes, who will teach you?”


We climbed back into the carriage.


“There is an inn in the town we will arrive at later with a skilled host. It is a place I really wanted to visit with my father. Since we couldn’t get the hostage, I will buy it!”


\* \* \*


Zhou Xiangyue had been having nightmares for the past few days. She usually didn’t have many dreams, but today’s promise was what put such pressure on her.


“Miss, it’s time to get ready.”


The servants came in with clothes.


Although the clothes were gorgeous and beautiful, Joo Hyang-wol took out a clean martial arts uniform from the closet.


“I’m going to wear this.”


“The master told me to wear these clothes.”


When Joo Hyang-wol looked at the Sibies coldly, they lowered their heads. That’s because they are the ones who won’t back down if you don’t do this.


“My mother will know that I will go out wearing a military uniform. So you don’t have to worry about getting scolded.”


Just then a woman’s voice was heard outside.


“That’s why I came myself.”


The woman who opened the door and came in was Lim So-hwa, the mother of Ju Hyang-wol and the head of the Ju family swordsmanship family.


“Put those clothes on and go.”


“no, I do not want.”


“Why do you hate it?”


Joo Hyang-wol stared at her mother.


Are you asking because you don’t know? Or are you pretending not to know?


“Don’t you know how important your meeting with Prince Huang is today?”


You don’t know what you’re talking about, Mother. What does that fancy palace have to do with today’s meeting? If you think it has.


Joo Hyang-wol felt these words rising to the tip of her tongue.


-Do you really want to sell your daughter to them?


But I couldn’t bring myself to say that. I knew I would regret saying it later.


Five years ago, my father passed away and the Zhou family quickly declined. My mother became the head of the household, but she could not fill my father’s empty seat. This choice was a mistake. I should have stepped down and left the position of head of the household to someone who could do it better.


Eventually, for various reasons, the swordsmen of the sword family left one by one. Now, only those who respected their father remained in the sword family, and they were having a hard time continuing the sword family’s tradition.


Meanwhile, the recently successful Hwangdo Trading Company has proposed joining hands with the Ju family. Today is the day of negotiations.


And mother knew.


The fact that Prince Hwang, who is coming to negotiate today, has feelings for his daughter. He chose his daughter as the negotiation partner. His mother’s choice was that splendid palace maid.


‘In times like this, you should tell me to wear my military uniform, so I put on this coat and go out. If you don’t even know that, why are you hurting me so clumsily!’


You are ready to hurt your mother. But you are surprised, hurt, jump up and down in anger, even though it is a wound you brought upon yourself, and look for your dead father.


I can’t even open my mouth because I keep thinking about that image.


When she arrived at the inn, the meeting place, with such complicated feelings, there was a scuffle between the Zodiac’s upper class’s unmanned personnel and a young man at the entrance.


“Why on earth won’t you let me in? I absolutely have to go in today!”
