## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Sunny cùng Effie và Kai ngồi vào bàn ăn, mỗi người được đưa một menu giấy kiểu cũ. Cậu nhìn chằm chằm vào chữ "steak" một lúc rồi rùng mình, chuyển sang mục salad.

Effie gọi ba phần bibimbap, ba phần samgyeopsal, ba bát jjajangmyeon và ba phần tteokbokki, sau đó quay sang hỏi Sunny và Kai muốn ăn gì. Sunny suýt sặc nước.

Kai tháo mũ và kính râm, tươi cười nói rất vui khi gặp lại Sunny và bảo cả hai đã rất lo lắng cho cậu. Sunny đáp lời cảm ơn. Effie hỏi cậu đã xảy ra chuyện gì và tại sao lại biến mất cả tháng trời. Sunny hỏi nên nghe phiên bản dài hay ngắn. Kai chọn phiên bản ngắn.

Sunny tóm tắt rằng cậu muốn tìm manh mối về kho báu, nhưng suýt bị rương kho báu ăn thịt, rơi xuống vực thẳm trên xác quỷ và bị thiêu đốt bởi ngọn lửa thần thánh. May mắn thay, có một giọng nói trong đầu đã giúp cậu chỉ bị bỏng nhẹ. Sâu trong vực thẳm, cậu tìm thấy một tòa tháp đen với những con búp bê vỡ và một cánh tay thối rữa bên trong, thứ mà cậu đã ăn. Từ tòa tháp đen, cậu đến một tòa tháp trắng trên bầu trời, rồi cưỡi đuôi rồng trở lại mặt đất. Trước đó, cậu đã tự sát và nhận được một Ký Ức (Memory) rất tốt.

Kai yêu cầu nghe phiên bản dài. Sunny kể lại mọi chuyện đã xảy ra trong hơn một tháng qua, giấu đi số lượng tiền Xu Thần Kỳ (miraculous coins), mọi thứ liên quan đến Weaver và lý do cậu muốn trở nên mạnh mẽ nhanh nhất có thể.

Effie nhận xét thuộc tính Định Mệnh (Fated) của cậu đã hoạt động quá mức. Sunny đồng ý và nói rằng chuyến thám hiểm này là một cơ hội tốt cho cậu. Kai hỏi về giọng nói - Mordret, và liệu Sunny có tin người đó không. Sunny nói rằng Mordret có lẽ là một trong những Kẻ Lưu Lạc (Lost), một người đã Thức Tỉnh (Awakened) và có thể liên lạc với cậu nhờ mảnh gương cậu nhặt được. Mọi thông tin Mordret cung cấp đều đúng và hữu ích, có lẽ cậu đã không còn sống nếu không có người đó. Kai cho rằng như vậy thì Mordret không có vấn đề gì.

Sunny hỏi Effie có muốn cùng cậu thử thách Cơn Ác Mộng Thứ Hai (Second Nightmare) không, dù cậu biết cô có thể dễ dàng tìm được những người Thức Tỉnh mạnh mẽ khác. Cậu dự định quay lại Tháp Ngà (Ivory Tower) và tiến vào Hạt Giống (Seed) sau bảy tháng, sau ngày đông chí. Effie đồng ý, nhưng với một điều kiện: Sunny phải thuyết phục Cassie tham gia cùng họ. Cô không quan tâm đến chuyện gì đã xảy ra giữa hai người họ, vì các thành viên trong nhóm không cần phải là bạn bè, chỉ cần phối hợp tốt với nhau. Hơn nữa, Cassie có thể giúp cậu lấy Dao Obsidian (Obsidian Knife) và Dao Ngà (Ivory Knife).

Sunny không muốn tha thứ cho Cassie, nhưng Effie nói đúng. Cassie là một lợi thế lớn cho bất kỳ nhóm nào, đặc biệt là khi cô đã tự tin hơn vào sức mạnh của mình. Cô cũng có những người sống sót khác từ Bờ Quên (Forgotten Shore) đi theo, và có mối liên hệ với các sứ giả của Gia Tộc Valor (Clan Valor) tại Đền Đêm (Night Temple). Sunny miễn cưỡng thừa nhận rằng Cassie đã học được một bài học cay đắng.

Kai bất ngờ lên tiếng muốn tham gia cùng họ để thử thách Cơn Ác Mộng Thứ Hai.

## Toàn bộ chương

**Chương 463**

Ba người ngồi xuống và được đưa cho những cuốn thực đơn giấy kiểu cũ để chọn món. Sunny nhìn chằm chằm vào chữ "steak" một lúc, rồi rùng mình và chuyển ánh mắt sang khu vực salad.

Vài phút sau, một người phục vụ tiến đến để nhận order. Effie lên tiếng:

"Cho… ba phần bibimbap (cơm trộn), ba phần samgyeopsal (thịt ba chỉ nướng), ba bát jjajangmyeon (mì tương đen), và ba phần tteokbokki (bánh gạo cay)."

Sau đó, cô quay sang Sunny và Kai, cười ngây thơ, và hỏi:

"...Ồ, còn hai người thì sao? Hai người định gọi gì?"

Sunny suýt sặc nước trong chiếc cốc thủy tinh tuyệt đẹp mà cậu đang uống.

Người phục vụ, bằng cách nào đó, vẫn giữ được vẻ mặt bình thản.

'Thật chuyên nghiệp...'

...Vì họ đang ngồi trong một gian riêng, Kai cuối cùng cũng tháo mũ và kính râm ra, rồi nở một nụ cười rạng rỡ. Giọng cậu nghe chân thành đến mức khiến Sunny bực mình... một chút.

"Rất vui được gặp lại cậu, Sunny. Effie và tớ đã rất lo lắng!"

Sunny hắng giọng.

"Ờ… cảm ơn. Tớ đoán vậy. Tớ cứ… cho rằng hai cậu sẽ không nhận ra là tớ biến mất."

Effie thở dài.

"Tớ bắt đầu ước là mình đã không nhận ra, đồ ngốc ạ! Mà này… chuyện quái gì đã xảy ra vậy? Sao cậu biến mất cả tháng trời?"

Sunny ngập ngừng, rồi nói:

"Cậu muốn nghe phiên bản dài, hay phiên bản ngắn?"

Kai nhìn cậu với vẻ tò mò:

"Bắt đầu với phiên bản ngắn trước đi, tớ nghĩ vậy?"

Sunny gãi đầu.

"Được thôi. Vậy thì, tóm lại là… tớ chỉ muốn tìm manh mối về một kho báu ẩn giấu, nhưng cuối cùng lại suýt bị một cái rương kho báu ăn thịt, rơi xuống một vực thẳm không đáy trên xác một con quỷ, và bị thiêu đốt bởi ngọn lửa thần thánh. May mắn thay, có một giọng nói mà tớ thỉnh thoảng nghe thấy trong đầu, và nó đã giúp tớ chỉ bị bỏng nhẹ."

Effie nghiêng đầu và nhìn cậu một cách kỳ lạ. Nụ cười của Kai nhạt đi một chút.

Sunny nhấp một ngụm nước và tiếp tục với giọng điệu vô tư:

"Dù sao thì, sâu trong khoảng không, tớ đã tìm thấy một tòa tháp đen. Bên trong có vài con búp bê vỡ và một cánh tay bị chặt đứt đang thối rữa, thứ mà tớ… ờ… đã ăn, kiểu vậy. Từ tòa tháp đen trong vực thẳm, tớ đến một tòa tháp trắng trên bầu trời, rồi cưỡi đuôi rồng trở lại mặt đất. Đại khái là thế. Ồ, và trước tất cả những điều đó, tớ đã tự sát, tớ đoán vậy. Cũng kiếm được một Ký Ức (Memory) rất ngon lành!"

Hai người nhìn chằm chằm vào cậu trong vài khoảnh khắc, rồi thở dài gần như đồng thời.

Kai lắc đầu.

"Tớ rút lại lời nói. Kể phiên bản dài đi…"

***

Sunny giải thích trình tự các sự kiện dẫn đến việc cậu biến mất hơn một tháng, giữ lại một vài điều cho riêng mình — chẳng hạn như số lượng thực tế của những đồng xu kỳ diệu mà cậu đã thu thập được, mọi thứ liên quan đến Weaver, và lý do thực sự khiến cậu tuyệt vọng muốn trở nên mạnh mẽ hơn càng nhanh càng tốt.

Khi cậu nói xong, Effie khúc khích cười.

"Chà. Thuộc tính [Định Mệnh] (Fated) của cậu dạo này hoạt động hết công suất nhỉ?"

Một biểu cảm chua chát xuất hiện trên khuôn mặt của Sunny.

"Tớ đoán vậy. Nhưng trước đó tớ đã có ba tháng ổn định, không có gì quá tệ hoặc quá tốt xảy ra. Nhưng vấn đề là, khi nó xảy ra, chuyện này thường dẫn đến chuyện khác. Không phải lúc nào cũng tệ, mặc dù vậy. Tớ đã phải làm việc thực sự chăm chỉ để sống sót, nhưng ngoài ra, chuyến thám hiểm này là một vận may đối với tớ."

Kai nhấp một ngụm trà, rồi nói một cách trầm ngâm:

"Còn giọng nói đó… Mordret? Cậu có tin hắn không?"

Sunny ngập ngừng, rồi nhún vai.

"Sau khi tớ chắc chắn rằng hắn không chỉ là sản phẩm của trí tưởng tượng của tớ, tớ đã tin rằng Mordret thực sự là một trong những Kẻ Lưu Lạc (Lost), và rất có thể là một Thức Tỉnh Giả (Awakened) giống như chúng ta. Rất có thể, hắn có thể giao tiếp với tớ ở một khoảng cách lớn vì mảnh gương mà tớ nhặt được sau khi hạ gục Tiếng Vọng (Echo) nhân tạo kỳ lạ của hắn. Nhưng ngoài ra thì… tớ không biết. Hắn rất bí ẩn, nói giảm nói tránh."

Cậu suy nghĩ một lúc, rồi nói thêm:

"Mọi thông tin hắn đưa cho tớ đều hóa ra là sự thật, cho đến nay. Và rất hữu ích. Có lẽ tớ đã không còn sống đến bây giờ nếu không có hắn. Vì vậy, thật khó để nói."

Kai mỉm cười.

"Chà, trong trường hợp đó, hắn ổn trong cuốn sách của tớ."

Sunny dừng lại khi người phục vụ tiến đến dọn dẹp những chiếc đĩa bẩn và rót đầy đồ uống cho họ. Sau khi họ lại ở một mình, cậu im lặng một lúc, rồi quay sang Effie:

"Nhưng dù sao thì… tớ tin rằng những gì hắn nói về Hạt Giống (Seed) là sự thật. Tớ nghĩ rằng tớ có thể lấy được Con Dao Obsidian (Obsidian Knife), thứ được cho là sẽ giúp Cơn Ác Mộng (Nightmare) trở nên dễ dàng hơn. Vì vậy… tớ muốn hỏi.
