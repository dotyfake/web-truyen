# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 224 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Sau khi nhậm chức Ma Gwang-ik-ju (Ma Gwang-ik Lord), Jeong Yeon-shin nhận ra tầm quan trọng của việc củng cố quyền lực và sức mạnh cho những người xung quanh mình, sau những mất mát trong sự kiện ở Sacheonseong Myeonggongdo. Cậu quyết tâm không để mất thêm bất kỳ ai nữa và bắt đầu ấp ủ ý định tạo ra một môn võ công mới không phải cho bản thân mà cho Ma Gwang-ik (Ma Gwang-ik).

Trong lúc Jeong Yeon-shin đang suy nghĩ về việc kết hợp các nguyên tắc của Seomye Martial Arts (Seomye Martial Arts) và Magwanggyeol (Magwanggyeol) để tạo ra môn võ công mới, Shin Seol-ha, tộc trưởng Ip Hwang-shin (Ip Hwang-shin), đến thăm. Shin Seol-ha ngạc nhiên trước sự thay đổi trong Jeong Yeon-shin, người giờ đây toát ra phong thái của một cao thủ. Jeong Yeon-shin bày tỏ lòng biết ơn đối với Shin Seol-ha vì đã nuôi dưỡng Shin So-bin, thuộc hạ của cậu.

Shin Seol-ha đề nghị gửi Youngcho và Naesangyak đến Ma Gwang-ik để hỗ trợ, coi đó là cách trả ơn Jeong Yeon-shin vì những đóng góp của cậu ở Sacheonseong. Jeong Yeon-shin chấp nhận lời đề nghị, nhận thấy sự cần thiết của việc bổ sung nguồn lực để huấn luyện môn võ công mới.

Khi Jeong Yeon-shin và Shin So-bin rời đi, Shin Seol-ha dặn dò Shin So-bin rằng nếu cảm thấy giới hạn của bản thân, cô có thể đến hỏi về Jecheonmu-gyeong (Jecheonmu-gyeong) bất cứ lúc nào, đồng thời khẳng định sẽ không can thiệp nếu cô muốn học Seomye Mu-maek (Seomye Mu-maek) và Ma-gwang-gyeol.

Sau khi trở về, Jeong Yeon-shin ở ẩn trong cung điện, không tiếp xúc với ai ngoài những người hầu mang thức ăn. Cheongmyeong và Baekmirye cũng ngạc nhiên trước sự việc này, nhưng không thể làm gì vì Seomye đã ra lệnh không cho ai vào.

Trong khi đó, bên ngoài, các cao thủ Ma Gwang-ik bàn tán xôn xao về việc Jeong Yeon-shin ở ẩn và sức mạnh của tộc trưởng Shin (Shinga). Kang Chang-mu và Wi Ye-ryeong luyện tập cùng nhau, sử dụng Gwanghwa Sword Style (Gwanghwa Sword Style) và Hwanikbo (Hwanikbo), đồng thời thảo luận về những khó khăn trong việc làm chủ các kỹ thuật này.

Đột nhiên, một luồng năng lượng đáng sợ lan tỏa từ bên trong Đại sảnh đường, báo hiệu sự xuất hiện của những cao thủ áo đen từ Ip Hwang Seong. Shingeombu Daeju, Yullyeong Daeju và Bohyeol Daeju đến thăm.

Ngay sau đó, một luồng khí động học tinh tế xuất hiện, lan tỏa qua bức tường của Đại sảnh đường và những tia sáng bắt đầu xuất hiện.

The new Ma Gwang-ik-ju paid no attention to the strange expression of the Ip Hwang-shin-ga-ju. I know what she thought of. Even just thinking back on her own conversations, it was the same.


‘There are many cases where the opposite is true.’


If Jeong Yeon-shin had been a woman, she would have mentioned her son. The leaders of the world who lead groups have been increasing their power through marriage since ancient times.


The clan he belonged to was considered that important. If he was a strong man in troubled times or a noble warrior, he was a man or woman.


It was a world where the law of the jungle prevailed. It was a world where everything was put to the test to enhance the honor of the group and strengthen its power.


It wasn’t a situation that Jeong Yeon-shin was interested in. All that mattered was filling Ma Gwang-ik’s spotless position.


Family and home.


It became clear with the incident at Sacheonseong Myeonggongdo. The seniors who died at that time were trampled upon.


The sense of loss that I tried to ignore was engraved on my heart as a scar. I realized it through this incident.


From now on, power must be filled. There should be no vacancy unless it is absolutely necessary.




The warmth that he encountered late was like seawater that he had never seen before. He said that the more he drank, the thirstier he became. Ma Gwang-ik was the same.


They are alive. They are not like Jeong Ga-dong-gong who follows his mother’s spirit. They were real.


‘I won’t lose any more.’


The words and actions of the new head of the Iphwangsin family actually encouraged Jeongyeonsin to awaken. The vessel of the head of the Ilmun clan sprouted like a flower bud in his heart.


Even the absence of one Shin So-bin is a reflection of the past. It’s okay not to have led the majority.


It was enough to remind me of their preciousness.


‘Seniors, peers, and juniors must become stronger. So that they can hold on to me on their own.’


Never leave Ma Gwang-ik’s arms in any way.


Ma Gwang-ik-ju Jeong Yeon-shin thought.


It felt like the upper part of my head was filled with a small light. It was the first time I had decided to create a martial art for others.




From the inside, the unmanned islander put on the skin of the great master, Magwangikju. At this moment, the vessel of a great master was polished without a sound.


After the years of loneliness that stretched out like a swamp, Jeong Ga-jang blossomed like a lotus flower blooming in a swamp.


A small step brought about a big change. Suddenly, I realized. Jeong Yeon-shin had never created a martial art for others to use.


He never did that. Up until now, his talents were only used for himself. And yet he achieved nothing.


‘But throwing away my ignorance wasn’t something I could expect to be of any use.’


Lost in thought.


‘From the beginning, it was a martial arts that represented Ma Gwang-ik… … .’


It would be good to combine the principles of Seomye Martial Arts and Magwanggyeol. This is because both the veteran and new martial artists of Magwangik need to be trained together.


It should also be respected. Just as the master Ma Gwang-ik is comparable to the plum blossom swordsmen, his martial arts should also be placed on the same level as the plum blossom swordsmanship. That is how it is for Ma Gwang-ik.


“Jeong Dae-ju?”




A call from the new world broke my meditation.


I raised my head. A puzzled expression came into view.


“Okay, take it.”


Jeong Yeon-shin said calmly.


I got up from my seat. A small rustling noise spread.


It was the sound of the stone chair scraping the floor, a unique sound of the Ip Hwang Seong. It filled the quiet room particularly clearly.


“… … .”


A strange look appeared on Shin Seol-ha’s face.


She was a Japanese person. She was sensitive to the temperamental changes of those she met.


The conduct of Jeong Yeon-shin, who had blossomed into a small enlightenment, was different from before. The atmosphere of a master breathing with divine energy follows the mind.


A strange sense of dignity began to be added to the small gestures. It was the island of Hogwangseong, and the king of Hwajungam of Sacheonseong.


Until you step outside.


Shin Seol didn’t say anything else. His intuition as the head of the household made him do so.


If you keep adding unnecessary words, you will be punished. The dignity of a black master was best known to the people of Ip Hwang Seong.


Jeongyeonshin opened her lips first.


“As Shin So-bin’s superior, I pay my respects. You raised my precious subordinate. I am grateful.”


“It’s a family that has produced the best lords of Bonseong for generations. If you’re the bloodline of the most prestigious family in Bonseong, you should be able to do that.”


Shin Seol-ha raised the corners of her lips and pretended to be coquettish.


Jeongyeonshin didn’t look at her. She absentmindedly focused her energy into the air. It was right after she heard the words, “The best of nature.”


It seemed like there was no one there. But it was meaningless.




If her grandfather was hiding, it would be difficult for Jeongyeonshin to find out. It was enough that no trouble had arisen right away.


“I will send Youngcho and Naesangyak to Ma Gwang-ik. They will be valuable support.”


Shin Seol-ha, who was walking ahead toward the gate, spoke. Jeong Yeon-shin stared blankly at her back.


“What do you mean?”


“It’s to repay a debt. Since the Lord Jeong Dae-ju was constantly on missions, I didn’t have time to repay his favor. If you hadn’t accomplished great deeds in Sacheonseong, something bad would have happened to the Lord Wonro.”


“Your attitude has changed.”


“It should have been so. Separate from Sobin’s work.”


Jeongyeonshin did not refuse. It would be necessary for the Ma Gwangik family to learn new martial arts.


The training of the unmanned was a method of shaving the flesh.


To quickly develop decent martial arts skills, good food and excellent medicinal herbs are essential, but it was a time when food and supplies were scarce due to crop failures.


It is difficult to obtain a certain quantity of elixirs and internal medicines that can help with health even from the General Office.


I had already requested it as a reward for the mission to conquer Gaepa War, but I had no idea how much I would be given.


‘The more the better.’


I have to create such a martial art, Jeongyeonshin thought.


A faint laughter rang out from in front. It was newly established.

“Let’s go.”


I stepped out the door she had opened for me. I could hear her hesitating.


Shin So-bin’s delicate and delicate energy was strangely disturbed. It seemed as if she was absorbed in meaningless words.


“let’s go.”


He said while looking at her small face. She was a girl with impressive, distinct eyes.


Shin So-bin nodded slightly.


“It’s been a long time. I’m glad you’re okay.”


“You’ve cleansed your body with the Shihwamugeukwon. It’s well-made. Your prayers are strong.”


“You recognized me right away.”


Her lips formed a curve. She was praised for her achievement by the founder of the martial arts. It is difficult for a martial artist to feel greater joy than this.


Most of the great masters of martial arts are long gone, from distant ancestors. It was a luxury that was difficult to enjoy in those days.


Behind her, the blue-clad master and the Nanming Sword Shin Baek stared at them with complicated eyes.


The collateral blue had no power to interfere with the family’s decision, and he had no intention of doing so.


The warm voice lingered in my ears as he spoke to me as if my luggage were his own.


‘rather…….’


As he flinched at the thought that came to his mind, Ma Gwang-ik-ju passed by him. The hem of his black sleeve flapped slightly at his side.


It was the first time that the black robe had come across so realistically. It was a figure running freely across the vast expanse of the rivers and lakes.


The master’s qi wave swept through the surroundings like a winter wind and then died down. None of the gathered warriors moved.


“I won’t be back for a long time.”


Shin So-bin spoke boldly. Her eyes looking up at the owner, Shin Seol-ha, were straight and clear.




“If you feel your limits, come ask me about Jecheonmu-gyeong at any time. It is not shameful. No matter how much you learn Seomye Mu-maek and Ma-gwang-gyeol, I will not interfere with that.”


Shin Seol-ha replied with a smile. It was a surprisingly affectionate smile.


Sabak.


Shin So-bin, who had snorted, turned around. Her footsteps were light as she followed behind her husband.


White and black, the performer and the great master left the garden together.


\* \* \*


The newly appointed Ma Gwang-ik-ju, who had retrieved his luggage, remained in seclusion.


After entering the palace, he never came out. He ate all his meals at the master’s quarters.


Only Ma Gwang-ik’s servants who brought meals into the room could see Daeju. He did not show his face for several days.


It was a chip residence.


Even Cheongmyeong and Baekmirye were taken aback by this unprecedented event. However, they could do nothing about it.


Seomye was their leader. They had to obey the order not to let anyone in.


The sun set and rose repeatedly. The shadows of the sunset stretching across the pavilion brushed the heads of Ma Gwang-ik’s masters nine times.


“It’s already the 9th day. Did the coin purse come?”


“That makes sense. They say there was a fierce battle at Shinga, so maybe he’s just calming down without saying anything… … .”


“You don’t want to worry us? That’s how it is with our great lord. He doesn’t show any signs of anything.”


It was sunset again.


The orange sun was setting. It was an evening where the clear air used the sunset as a blanket.


Under the high walls surrounding the three sides of the Daeyeonmujang, the masters of Ma Gwang-ik clashed their weapons or practiced.


There were many who looked down on them, some crouching on the high wall, others standing tall on the roof of the opposite pavilion.




Those who stepped on the top of the tiles mainly looked at the residence of the great lord. It was the style of Ma Gwang-ik. It had an atmosphere that was in contrast to the Jeongpa Myungmun.


There were about thirty of them. Those who had gone on a solo mission had already returned.


“Rumor has it that he only dealt with Gaju. There’s talk that he fought Daeju one-on-one.”


“Was the skill of the new god really enough to inflict an injury on the great lord? I thought it was inferior to that of the black one.”


“But he is the owner of a prestigious family. He must have hidden at least one life-saving medicine. Or activated a hidden organ.”


“Enough with the internal strife. If that were true, the Blue Eye Demon Sword would have recognized it right away. That’s enough. Let’s just help those guys train. They’ll come out on their own.”


Those who had been talking in different positions turned their heads.


The gaze was focused on one side.


Kang Chang-mu, holding a large sword, and Wi Ye-ryeong, holding a bow, were hanging out together. A large-bodied Han Chinese and a nimble Ming Chinese master.


The blade grazed the hem of the blue robe as the dharma became entangled.


They are blue-clad masters known as Hyosu Sword and Sawolgunggui, and the martial arts they are using are Gwanghwa Sword Style and Hwanikbo.


Kuung!


Kang Chang-moo’s great sword swung down. The straight sword strike split left and right in front of Wi Ye-ryeong’s legs.


It was just dust on the floor. It was a fantastic sight to see his skills at their peak.


The same was true for Hyosu Sword Master Kang Chang-mu’s Gwanghwa Sword Style. A very faint halo of light enveloped the sword body.


He immediately raised the sword that had been stuck down, and the sound of the sword cutting through the air was tremendous. It was as if stone chips were flying everywhere.


“It splits here.”


Wi Ye-ryeong, carrying a backpack, muttered.


She didn’t move. She stood proudly and faced the sword strike. She opened her eyes clearly with courage befitting her ears that were turned up like swordsmanship.


Hwaaaaak―




A sharp wind swept across his face. The walls of Wiye-ryeong’s eyes flashed with a cold texture. It wasn’t the sharp wind of a sword.


The corners of Kang Chang-moo’s lips slightly raised. It wasn’t because he liked it. It was a hollow smile.


“According to the study of Magwanggyeol, it is appropriate to raise it… … .”


“I know. It’s hard to keep up.”


Wi Ye-ryeong answered with her arms crossed.


widely!


Kang Chang-moo lowered his head and put his sword into the armor behind his back. It was an incredibly quick movement, without even looking back.


The blade moved dimly and disappeared in an instant. It was a masterful sword. It was also a sight that proved the exquisite swordsmanship skills.


He opened his mouth.


“It didn’t seem like you were in a state to step on the Hwanikbo consecutively either.”


“That’s right. I had to spread my energy up and down from the Taegyehyeol (太谿穴) point on the peach bone, but I had already used it once. The veins didn’t react immediately. If this was a real fight, I would have used my own martial arts.”


“My sword path is blocked as well. It’s hard to stretch out any further. The problem is not the blood vessels, but the muscle bundles in my forearms. If I want to continue the attack, I have to fine-tune it and cause internal energization. Only when that becomes possible can I discuss the ten star realms of the Gwanghwa Sword Style. In the end, what Hwangbo said was not wrong.”


Kang Chang-moo glanced upward and said.


Taeyeonryong was lying on the corner of the roof, eating poppies. It looked like he was using the tiles of the Magwangikju pavilion as a bed.


He hadn’t even glanced at Seomye Mu-maek since the fight with Kang Chang-mu.


All he could see was a figure standing guard over Jeong Yeon-shin with a relaxed demeanor.


Wi Ye-ryeong uncrossed her arms.


“All the martial arts of the island are like that. They emphasize single-hit attacks, so they are one-shot. Only the Great Lord can use them continuously. It’s a difference in skill. You realize this after you’ve practiced them to some extent… .”


She trailed off.


Beyond the walls of the Great Hall of the People, terrifying waves of energy rippled. It was a scale that could not be discussed as a blue achievement.




The pressure that suddenly spread across all directions was enormous.


There are people in the world of martial arts who embody unstoppable power in human form.


When they enter the Ip Hwang Seong, they wear pitch-black robes. They are masters of black. A clear presence spreads from beyond the walls.


“Are you here? How can there be no answer even if I tell you? Are you concerned about the fact that I called you an enemy? What if that’s really the case?”


“If you are in the middle of closed-door training, it is right to turn back.”


“Don’t be ridiculous. You were the one who asked to come. Pah… um, you’re obsessed with books. Bloodstain, you say something too. Our pretty youngest skipped the meeting.”


“It doesn’t concern me. I’m just curious about the well-being of the men I sent to Ma Gwang-ik. I heard that Jeong Dae-ju is currently in hiding… … .”


“Are you afraid of our island?”


“I just respect my junior’s private time.”


It was a speech and voice that everyone knew.


It was the procession of the Shingeombu Daeju, the Yullyeong Daeju, and the Bohyeol Daeju. The freely lying Ma Gwang-ik masters slowly got up.


It was impossible to welcome the leader of another armed force with such a lax attitude.


That was when.


Could it be a reaction to the powerful waves of the major shareholders?


A subtle aerodynamic ripple occurred. It rippled across the wall of the Great Hall of the Great Warriors, through the gap in the door of the magnificently built Great Hall.


Suddenly, sparks of light appeared. They even pierced through the cracks in the tiles where the Taeyeonryong was lying.


Then, rays of light made of light waves began to flow out like smoke.
