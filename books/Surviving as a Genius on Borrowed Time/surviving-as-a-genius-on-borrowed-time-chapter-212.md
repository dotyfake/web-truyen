# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 212 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Cheongmyeong và các cao thủ áo xanh của Ma Gwang-ik đối mặt với khoảng ba mươi cao thủ từ Iphwangmaga, dẫn đầu bởi Joo Yeon-jeong. Joo Yeon-jeong yêu cầu Ma Gwang-ik ngừng việc sử dụng Đại Hoàn Đan (Daehwandan) mà không thông qua y quán, cảnh báo về hậu quả nghiêm trọng và đề nghị "nương tay" nếu Ma Gwang-ik chịu dừng lại.

Cheongmyeong phản bác, khẳng định sự tin tưởng vào Ma Gwang-ik và chỉ trích sự thiếu tin tưởng của Iphwangseong đối với Hắc Đế của Iphwangseong (Black Emperor of Iphwangseong). Joo Yeon-jeong lo ngại về sự an toàn của Tử Sư (Purple Master) và cho rằng việc can thiệp bằng năng lượng lớn có thể gây hại, thay vào đó nên để y quán xử lý. Cheongmyeong bác bỏ điều này, cho rằng đó là "sự can thiệp vô ích, hoặc sự tự tin sinh ra từ sự thiếu hiểu biết".

Joo Yeon-jeong ra lệnh cho một thuộc hạ trẻ báo cáo chi tiết sự việc lên Tổng Quản (General Office), bao gồm cả hành vi tùy tiện của Ma Gwang-ik. Cheongmyeong không ngăn cản hành động này. Joo Yeon-jeong nhận ra sự tin tưởng tuyệt đối mà các thuộc hạ dành cho Ma Gwang-ik, đồng thời lo ngại về hậu quả chính trị nếu gia tộc Taesang tự ý hành động.

Cheongmyeong hỏi: "Sẽ mất bao lâu?". Baek Mi-ryeo đáp lại bằng thần giao cách cảm rằng cần ít nhất vài giờ để luyện hóa Đại Hoàn Đan bằng Chính Khí Đoán Công (Jeonggadonggong). Baek Mi-ryeo tiến lên, giải phóng khí công hệ Hắc Ám (Jin-gi) hiếm có của mình. Joo Yeon-jeong ra lệnh cho các cao thủ Iphwangma không nương tay, hy vọng sự hỗn loạn sẽ khiến Ma Gwang-ik phải xuất hiện. Baek Mi-ryeo chuẩn bị thi triển Thiên Ma Thủ (Heavenly Magical Trick, Simple Hand Magical Skill), trong khi các cao thủ áo xanh của Ma Gwang-ik rút kiếm, sẵn sàng chiến đấu và rời đi một cách lặng lẽ nhất có thể.

Trong một diễn biến khác, các thành viên của Thần Kiếm Đoàn (Shingeomdan), bao gồm Iphwangsinchang Aksurim, Cheonrimdaeju Hahuwijin, Bohyeoldaeju Jinmyeongjo, Seonmokryeongju Cheonsoso, Yulryeongdaeju Unsoyu, cùng các đại sư khác, tập trung tại một địa điểm bí mật. Tổng chỉ huy (Grand General) Im Jin-myeong thông báo rằng Ma Gwang đang bận việc riêng và đề cập đến việc Liên Minh Võ Lâm (Murim Alliance) gây khó khăn cho Tổng bộ. Ông cũng nói rằng các giáo phái Chính Tông (Jeongjong) đang ly khai liên minh do bất mãn với Kiếm Thánh (Sword Saint). Aksurim và Jinmyeongjo thể hiện sự khó chịu trước tình hình này. Tổng chỉ huy Im Jin-myeong lấy ra một cuốn sách có tên "Phá Bạch" (Pa-Baek).

The blue-haired masters of Ma Gwang-ik furrowed their brows slightly.


“How scary.”


“It looks like you brought all the available power. Speaking from Mrs. Joo’s perspective.”


“Are you going to try it once, despite the law and all?”


“Our lord gave us the excuse. They had nothing to be afraid of in the first place.”


Behind the main stage, there were about thirty masters, wearing the noble prayer clothes characteristic of a prestigious school.


They are unmanned people who have not undergone the Iphwangsi, and are not part of the Shingumdan, but rather the Iphwangmaga.


Silk robes of all kinds of colors scattered the sunset brilliantly. There was not a single one who was not extraordinary.


The age range was also diverse.


The young warriors with distinct complexions on their faces pose no great threat to Ma Gwang-ik.




The problem was the middle-aged masters with colorless eyes.


Each of them is staring at Ma Gwang-ik with heavy eyes. Ip Hwang-ma is at the age when his achievements in the Hap Hwa Shingong are at their peak.


Even if it wasn’t good enough, it was worth discussing the color blue. It shouldn’t be considered an ordinary color blue.


The explosive power of Maga’s martial arts was dangerous even if you were careful. The martial arts he possessed must have been honed to a very sharp level.


“You brought the middle-aged people too. The previous leaders are having a hard time.”


Cheongmyeong, sitting on the roof of the pavilion, spoke with a smile. The wind that enveloped his entire body was different from his expression.


The sharp wind scratched the blue roof tiles. Scratches like solid lines spread endlessly along the wind.


Kagagak.


The energy that spreads out from the whole body is already sharp like refined waves.


A sight similar to the magic of the island of Magwangikju.




It looks scary because of the famous anecdote.


The story goes that Cheong-an-mageom Cheong-myeong taught my lord the movements of the Ming clan, and that Magwang-ik-ju recreated them into a martial arts formula and made them into a martial art.


There were many people waiting for the gift of martial arts in Bonseong Cheongummugo.


It was right after Ma Gwang-ik-ju fought with Seon Mok-ryeong-ju. Fights between great lords are a huge deal.


Many people from the Iphwangma side also attended. This meant that there were quite a few people who were learning about it for the first time.


“… … They certainly resemble each other. It is rumored that he contributed to the advancement of the achievements of the Magwangik Movement.”


“You’re saying that because you’re young. Originally, I was the first. I was being considered as the next Magwangikju.”


“You, the ones below, should keep this in mind. The swordsman of that famous clan is renowned for his sharpness, so you should never let your guard down.”


“Let’s compare it to the Haphwasingeom (Sword of the Gods of Combination).”


Joo Yeon-jeong, with many young and middle-aged experts behind her, looked serious.




“Your Majesty the Grand Master should rest in peace at your home. You should no longer cover up the sins of your former master. This is a matter that should be referred to the General Office. Today’s incident will not end with a light punishment, but if you step down now, I will show special mercy.”


“Do you know why we came here?”


Cheongmyeong asked, smiling brightly.


Joo Yeon-jeong opened her mouth after a moment of silence.


“…Magwangikju has obtained the Daehwandan. It seems like he is trying to do something without going through the medical hall. It is very reckless. There is a chance that both of you will end up in trouble. You should open the way. You should do it for the sake of your Daeju.”


“It’s a matter of trust. You have no right to doubt our lord’s skills. You are a famous family under the Bonseong Mountains, but you seem to lack faith in the Black Emperor of Iphwangseong.”


“No one looks down on the natural beauty of nature. This is also true of me. You must know this as well.”


“then?”


“It’s a matter of the safety of the Purple Master. Don’t you understand that it’s not something that the two of you can decide? Even if the study of the Island Master is rigorous, there’s no guarantee that the body of the Supreme Master will show signs of improvement. Rather than trying to manipulate the enormous energy with reckless efforts, wouldn’t it be right to leave everything to the medicine hall of the original nature?”


“Our Lord warns against that. Useless meddling, or confidence born of ignorance. An authoritarian figure like you is quick-witted but confined to limits.”


“Speak straight.”


Joo Yeon-jeong spoke in a low voice. It was a tone of voice that seemed to be giving orders as a superior, but perhaps because she was of royal descent, there was no awkwardness in her words and actions.


The heel of Cheongmyeong lightly touched the roof and came down.


“There’s no reason to go around and around. It’s something that can obviously be done quickly.”


Joo Yeon-jeong didn’t answer any further. She just turned her head slightly and gave a short wink to one of the young men.


“You must go to the General Office and report this matter in detail. You must not leave anything out. You must report everything, including Ma Gwang-ik’s wanton behavior, his violation of the law and his actions against the family’s military leaders, and even the arbitrary decisions of the head of the household and Ma Gwang-ik.”


“I obey your orders.”


A young man wearing green silk robes answered.


Percussion!


Then, he immediately returned the way he came, performing light martial arts.




None of Ma Gwang-ik’s men tried to stop him. All fifteen of them, except Cheongmyeong, stood there blankly, staring blankly at his retreating figure.


The ends of the blue robes, each draped in a different style, swayed slightly in the transparent breeze.


Cheongmyeong’s words are correct.


It was a sight that proved their trust in their leader.


Joo Yeon-jeong’s eyes sank.


‘This is no ordinary thing.’


She thought.


The unmanned personnel of Iphwangseong were all called Gijae in their hometown.


If I have studied Qigong to the point of reaching the level of the blue one, I should at least say that there is no such thing as absurd nonsense.


I can see that things are not going well today.


Perhaps, it may be because of the true nature of the Magwangikju that the Supreme Master will be able to move.


‘No, that won’t work.’


It will be difficult to recover the martial arts. I have already received a warning from the members of the medical party.


However, it is problematic for the Taesang family to even move on their own. A political storm is bound to hit the prestigious Iphwangma family.


It was an event that shook the faction of Joo Yeon-jeong, who had worked so hard to build up.

The symbolism of the tyrannical Ma Yeon-jeok was so enormous.


It cannot be left alone.


‘It is impossible to defeat Magwangik head-on in a short period of time.’


She calmly calculated the power.


The majority of the masters from the Ip Hwang Ma family are already dispersed among the 17th generation of the Shin Geum Dan. That is why they are receiving tremendous support and budget from the General Office.


Those who are now behind Joo Yeon-jeong are about half of the minimum members who maintain the family.


It is not a power that can confidently discuss overwhelming the blue-clad masters in front of you. Even if Ma Gwang-ik was weakened by the incident at Sacheonseong Myeonggongdo, it is the same.


It was one of the seventeen swords that made up the Shingeomdan. Even though it was weak, its power could not be underestimated.


A strategy was needed.


“The plot is so complicated. There’s no way we can compromise.”


Cheongmyeong said. He raised one knee on the roof and stared at Jooyeonjeong with his cool blue eyes.


It was the eye of a noble clan.


“How long will it take?”


He asked as if he was talking to himself. The answer came back from below.


―I think I’ll have to think about it for at least a few hours. The Great Hwandan is not an ordinary elixir. If I’m going to melt it with the Great Lord’s Jeonggadonggong, I’ll have to set aside a very long amount of time.


It was Baek Mi-ryeo’s transmission.


Before she knew it, she was stepping forward.


Damn it.


A black stream of air rose from the soles of my feet. It was a sign of the onset of my qigong.


The strange black mist grew one strand at a time with each step.




The typology of Jin-gi is a very rare study. It was a martial art whose origins were difficult for anyone to fathom. In an instant, everyone’s attention was drawn to it.


“The pure energy of silence… … is a series of swords.”


“It’s just as I heard. Isn’t it similar to magic?”


The warriors of the Iphwangma family began to approach.


Joo Yeon-jeong didn’t stop him. She straightened her back and looked at Ma Gwang-ik’s masters with her backpack on her back.


“Don’t spare your strength. If you feel any commotion, Ma Gwang-ik-ju will open the door and come out on his own.”


She said with an indifferent face.


I secretly hoped that the fortune of the island would be disrupted. The clash of masters with this scale and martial arts skills would be tremendous.


The walls of such a small pavilion cannot block it. That was what Joo Yeon-jeong was aiming for.


“Nonsense.”


Baek Mi-ryeo nodded coldly.


Heavenly Magical Trick, Simple Hand Magical Skill.


Saaaaa―


Baek Mi-ryeo’s hands turned as white as snow. Before she knew it, they formed a stark contrast to the jet-black air currents flowing through her entire body.


It wasn’t just Ilryeon Geommae who was ready.


“Minimum amount of noise. If you are skilled in the art of retrieval, let’s leave as quietly as possible.”


“Don’t advise someone who is inexperienced in the arts. Hasn’t he yet learned the principles of competent steelmaking?”


“This is a situation where a sword that kills with one blow is the right choice. I should have brought the Hyeonwonchang.”


“The same goes for Yeolyangjigi. If that Hwangbo gnome hadn’t prepared for promotion… … .”


Ma Gwang-ik’s blue masters drew their swords one by one.




Soon, they quietly took off.


\* \* \*


The stone gate with the engraved tree opened silently.


People wearing pitch-black robes walked in slowly.


Each had a different height and build. The same was true of the subtle air they emanated.


Iphwangsinchang Aksurim, Cheonrimdaeju Hahuwijin, Bohyeoldaeju Jinmyeongjo, Seonmokryeongju Cheonsoso, Yulryeongdaeju Unsoyu… … .


Behind them, they each carried a master wearing white or blue martial arts uniforms. They were all warriors who accompanied the great lords.


They all moved slowly and sat down in front of a huge table that looked like several pieces of log had been glued together.


Each chair was as large and ornate as the grand sacrificial rites of a great sect leader.


The gray-white backrests were as high as the head of the Heavenly Forest Lord Xiahou Weijin. There were eighteen of them in total.


This is the space for the Shingeomdanju, Shingeombuju, and the other sixteen major lords.


I wish for peace in the sword field.


The seats surrounding the stone round table were filled with grand masters. The escorts stood on the sides of chairs carved from marble. Everyone was neatly groomed.


Five black-eyed people gathered together.


Woof.


The powerful aerodynamic forces resonated on their own.


A heavy pressure was felt.


It was a position that could be rivaled by anything in the world.


When a natural aerodynamic phenomenon occurs, invisible aerodynamic waves rise up in a thick layer as if they have a physical form.


The breathing of the bodyguards gradually became longer. It was a difficult position to endure without properly exhaling the internal energy.




“What about the magic light?”


Xiahou Weijin let out a thick voice.


“I am away on personal business.”


It was the answer that came through the crack in the door of the Wonpyeongilgeomjang.


Heavy footsteps rang out. Then, a large, middle-aged man opened the stone gate and came in.


“Everyone is here. I was wondering if I should go catch Cheonrimdaeju again.”


He was a sturdy man who looked good in a brown suit.


He had a thick black beard and big eyes, and his gaze was full of love and hate as he looked at the lords.


He muttered softly. They seem like solid bundles of thoughts.


The commander-in-chief was Im Jin-myeong.


The Heavenly Forest Lord, Xiahou Weijin, laughed fiercely.


“Personal business? Is there anything more important than the meeting with the Lord?”


“There are a couple. We’ll find out soon enough. Good or bad.”


The Grand General answered nonchalantly.


And then he continued speaking slowly.


“You probably know that the formation of the Murim Alliance has caused a headache for our headquarters. Even though the major lords are extremely indifferent to our affairs.”


“Are you talking about the rumor that not only the Menghui in Shaanxi, but also the Jeongjong sects all over the world are uniting and disintegrating?”


The noblewoman, who was sitting upright, asked.


Sharp ears like swords stand out above the flowing black hair. Her beautiful facial features matched her calm expression. She was the leader of the Yullyeongdaeju, Unsoyu.


The Grand General laughed.




“The Lord of Un is helping this Im Mo. That’s right. Even the flies have come to know the power of unity. Even the sects that formed the alliance have broken away and are each seeking their own way of survival. It seems that they were not satisfied with the reign of the Sword Saint.”


“Are you saying that the enemies of nature have become stronger? The arrows that used to be broken one by one are now grouped together in groups of five or ten? It’s a hassle.”


Aksurim said rudely.


“What the heck?”


The blood-sucking spirit Jinmyeongjo opened his bright red lips.


“You called me for that? Is there any other way? We have no choice but to fight until we die. That’s how our Iphwangseong warriors ended up getting stabbed in the mountains.”


“The words and actions of a prospective bloodthirsty are always so vulgar. Please keep quiet for a moment. So that the Grand Master can get to the main point.”


The famous Cheon So-so said it casually.


It was a familiar sight.


The Grand General sighed and put his hand into his bosom.


Swish.


A book was pulled out from his chest. The words “Pa-Baek” (破白) slowly appeared.
