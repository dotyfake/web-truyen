# Absolute Regression Chapter 182 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Sau khi nghe Kwon Ma nói sẽ phá hủy vách đá chỉ bằng một cú đấm, nhân vật chính (tôi) đã nảy sinh khao khát được thử sức. Cậu đến gặp cha mình để xin phép học võ từ Kwon Ma. Ban đầu, cậu chỉ muốn xem phản ứng của anh trai mình, nhưng lời nói của Kwon Ma đã khiến cậu thay đổi.

Cha của nhân vật chính đồng ý, nhưng cảnh báo cậu rằng việc thân thiết với Kwon Ma có thể dẫn đến xung đột, vì Kwon Ma là người không bao giờ chịu thua. Ông cũng nhắc nhở cậu rằng sự ngây thơ của cậu có thể là điểm yếu, nhưng đôi khi cũng có lợi thế. Nhân vật chính đáp lại rằng cậu muốn sống một cuộc đời mà ít nhất một lần trở thành mục tiêu của ai đó.

Ngày hôm sau, cậu đến chỗ Kwon Ma đang quan sát các đệ tử Thiết Quyền (Iron Fist) luyện tập. Ban đầu, Kwon Ma tỏ vẻ không quan tâm, nhưng cậu vẫn kiên trì tập luyện theo các đệ tử Thiết Quyền. Cậu nhận ra đây là cơ hội để xây dựng nền tảng võ thuật vững chắc, kết hợp với những kiến thức và kỹ năng đã có từ trước.

Sau vài ngày, cậu bắt đầu đặt câu hỏi trong lúc luyện tập, khiến mọi người ngạc nhiên. Kwon Ma cũng bất ngờ nhưng vẫn trả lời. Dần dần, các đệ tử Thiết Quyền bắt đầu lắng nghe và học hỏi từ cậu. Sau năm ngày, cậu đã có thể sử dụng thành thạo thức đầu tiên của Thiết Quyền.

Vào ngày thứ bảy, sau khi buổi tập chính thức kết thúc, cậu vẫn ở lại luyện tập một mình. Kwon Ma quan sát cậu và hỏi cậu muốn gì. Cậu bày tỏ mong muốn trở thành đệ tử của Kwon Ma. Kwon Ma ngạc nhiên vì con trai của Thiên Ma (Cheonma) chưa từng làm đệ tử của Ma giáo (Majon). Cậu giải thích rằng cậu muốn Kwon Ma ngăn cản anh em cậu vượt quá giới hạn trong cuộc chiến tranh giành vị trí người kế vị. Cậu tin rằng Kwon Ma là người duy nhất có thể đánh bại cậu và anh trai nếu họ đi sai đường.

Kwon Ma tung một cú đấm cực nhanh về phía cậu, nhưng dừng lại ngay trước mặt cậu, tạo ra một lỗ lớn trên bức tường phía sau. Sau đó, Kwon Ma quay lưng bỏ đi. Trước khi đi, Kwon Ma nói với cậu rằng từ ngày mai hãy đến trung tâm huấn luyện Thanh Quyền (Cheonggwon).

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-181/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-183/)Question 182: I have a question!




I didn’t know that even the undefeated horse would know that.


I never thought I would say something like that to Kwon Ma. But the moment I heard Kwon Ma say that he would destroy the cliff with one blow, something inside me lit up.


It was an intense desire to throw my fist at his impossible challenge.


Kwonma’s gaze, which had been staring at my two eyes, turned to my hand.


“With that baby’s hand?”


Ah, the day will come when my hands will become like a baby’s hands.


“Compared to the Kwon Ma-nim, he is very small and cute, but in the human world, he is born with pretty good hands.”


“Stop talking nonsense and go back.”


The horse left the place with a cold wind blowing.


I looked up at the cliff again.




If a fist were to fly that could destroy this thing in one blow, would the self-defense weapon be able to withstand it?


Tension entered his clenched fist.


\* \* \*


That afternoon, I went to see my father and played baduk for the first time in a long time.


The refreshing sound of the stones being placed one by one calmed my mind. Perhaps the reason why playing Go with my father is so comfortable is because it resembles a game of Go. When I step onto the stage or start playing Go, I don’t need to say anything to my opponent.


“I lost.”


The last game we played, I won by two houses, but today I finally lost by six houses. When I saw the smile on my father’s face, I couldn’t help but think that I couldn’t stop him. Whether it was baduk or martial arts, my father couldn’t live without losing.


“When you have time, learn some baduk from Sima Junshi.”


“I guess so.”


“Why did you come today?”




My father had already noticed that I had come to him on business.


“Do you get a feeling when you see a person?”


“You’re acting unusually impatient today. Those low-level players tend to show off their skills.”


“What a waste! Today is your first win.”


I felt good inside. It meant that my father was concerned about my feelings while playing Go.


“There is something I would like to ask permission from my father.”


“What?”


“I would like to learn martial arts from Kwon Ma. Please allow me.”


My father didn’t show any particular reaction, as if he had expected it.


“If you want to learn, then learn. Why do you need my permission?”




“Of course I have to tell you and learn. I also have to get my father’s permission.”


“What if I don’t give permission?”


“I have to try harder to get permission.”


I told my father honestly how I felt.


“At first, I had a strong desire to strike the east and strike the west. I was just trying to see how my brother would react if I hit him. But today, Kwon-ma said that his goal was to knock down the cliff with one blow.”


My father seemed to know that goal. He wasn’t surprised at all by what I said.


“At those words, it wasn’t the cliff that broke, but my guard. I thought it was cool, and I wanted to break down the cliff too.”


“It’s your chronic weakness. Your naive emotions that are perfect for dying.”


When he first said that, he said, “It’s a cheap sentiment that’s perfect for dying.” Now, the cheapness has disappeared and innocence has taken its place. That’s how close I became to my father.


“That naivety can sometimes work to your advantage. There are also some Amazons that you can get thanks to it.”


“Get it? Do you really think the Amazons are on your side?”


My father really didn’t trust anyone. Maybe my father’s values were essential for the leader of the church.


“I believe that there is no absolute heart in the world other than the heart of a parent towards their child. However, I am trying not to create a situation where the hearts of the demons will change.”


It’s rare for people to suddenly change their minds while living. People usually change because their circumstances change.


“Do you know that? If you become entangled with Kwon-ma and Mu-gong, there will inevitably come a time when you will have to fight him. He is the type of person who can never lose. Then the results may be different from what you intended.”


It was something I could say because I knew Kwon-ma’s personality well. It meant that if you try to become closer, your relationship could get worse.


“What happens if I win?”


“His target will be you, not the cliff.”


After a moment, I spoke to my father.


“Wouldn’t it be worth living a life where you become someone’s goal at least once?”




My father stared at me for a moment and then nodded.


“A horseman will need to find the right way to do things.”


He told me not to try to get lucky by tricking people, but to do my best with sincerity. My father gave me permission.


“thank you.”


After I politely greeted my father and turned around, he spoke from behind me.


“From now on, I am Baekdol.”


“You have to win three games in a row?”


“The law has changed as of today.”


What can I do if Cheonma says he wants to change it?


“Then I must teach my soldiers how to play Go as soon as possible.”


\* \* \*


I went to see Kwonma again the next day.


He, who had missed training for a few days, was watching the Iron Fist practitioners training today.


His reaction to me was the same as the first day. He glanced at me and then turned his gaze back to the iron fist. But our relationship was clearly different than the first day.


“Can I learn alongside you, Iron Fist?”

Kwonma looked at me. His face was still fierce. If someone else saw it, they would say he was glaring at me as if he was going to kill me, but I could read the emotion in his eyes.


Do you really want to learn martial arts from me?


I answered with a determined look in my eyes.


yes.


Kwonma looked at me with a laughable look, then nodded. His attitude was to see how I would react.


“thank you.”


I placed my sword aside and followed the Iron Fist’s stance.


It was the first time in my life that I learned martial arts. I had never learned martial arts before returning. Fighting without a sword in my hand? It’s hard to imagine.


The eyes of the iron fists that passed by me were full of surprise.


Since the Heavenly Demon’s Duke has come forward to learn martial arts with them, there is no need for a side dish for the drinks tonight.


Kwon Ma didn’t teach me anything.


I followed the movements of the iron fists. This martial art, which dozens of people are learning, cannot be the unconquerable martial arts of the Dokmun. It must be the basic martial arts learned by the Dongkwonmun martial arts.


On the contrary, it is good. I know better than anyone that the martial arts that can destroy a mountain also originate from this basic movement.


I made the right moves.


I watched them practice for several days, and most importantly, I saw dozens of them in the same pose right before my eyes.


Even if someone was in the wrong posture, there were more people who were in the right posture. Thanks to that, I was able to get the right posture.


So the first day of training ended and everyone quietly dispersed. I, too, left the place as if I were one of them.


I participated in the training the next day too.


The Dongkwonmun’s iron fists were divided into four categories according to skill.


Baekkwon (白拳) wearing white uniforms, Cheongkwon (靑拳) wearing blue uniforms, Jeokkwon (赤拳) wearing red uniforms, and Heukkwon (黑拳) wearing black uniforms.




The people I am with now are Baek Kwon, wearing white uniforms. Of course, you shouldn’t ignore Baek Kwon. The fact that he was able to enter Dongkwonmun meant that he was not a lowly person.


Was it a waste of time to train with Baekwon? No way. It was actually better because I was able to build a solid foundation from the ground up.


My martial arts skills were at a level where I could anticipate dozens of changes from a single small movement.


From the basic movement of throwing a punch, I thought of dozens of situations and anticipated changes. The Wind God Sabo and the current supernatural technique were combined in my head. Since the Wind God Sabo was a great combination with the Bicheon Sword Technique, it naturally created a fantastic harmony with the martial arts.


I was very passionate about practicing martial arts, but Kwon Ma still didn’t seem to trust me. I could read it in his expression.


Even so, would you come out for a month? Would you come out for a year?


He just gave me a laughable look because he had these thoughts in mind.


But the opponent was me. I even asked a question the next day.


“I have a question!”


Everyone was startled by my shout. Come to think of it, I have never seen them ask questions during the training. They just took the poses they were told to take.


So I guess I’m not the first one to ask the question.


Kwon Ma was also surprised. He probably never thought I would ask him a question.


“When rotating the right foot in this tiger-in-the-wing pose, how much freedom is allowed for the left foot?”


Everyone had their left foot completely still, but I thought it would be more effective if they moved it slightly.


I felt a sense of commotion around me. Is this okay? No, how dare I ask a question? How will the Kwon Ma react? Will we also be struck by lightning? I felt a thousand different emotions.


But surprisingly, Kwon-ma answered the questions without much resistance.


“When you complete the last turn, if your body doesn’t shake, you don’t have to restrict your left foot.”


In response to Kwonma’s clear answer, I tried to do as he told me.


My left foot moved slightly, but it was to quickly connect to the next movement. Right now, I am practicing by breaking up each movement, but in real life, continuous movements are important.


For the first time, the Iron Fist’s gaze turned to me. They didn’t know yet. What they were seeing now was not a change in the herbivore. It was a change in the Dongkwonmun training that had been solidified for a long time.




I went to the training center the next day, and the day after that.


I didn’t ask questions for the sake of asking questions. I just asked questions that I was really curious about, and when I asked questions, the Iron Fist listened. It was like I was asking questions that they were curious about but didn’t dare ask. After finishing the training, the Iron Fist came to greet me.


After five days, I was able to use the first form of the most proper form of the Tekken that I learned there. Even when I finished training, there were people who asked me about the movements.


It was the seventh day.


Even though formal training was over, I stayed behind and continued to train. I was immersed in a new world led by martial arts. Regardless of my current situation, learning martial arts itself was fun.


I felt Kwonma watching me, but I paid no attention and focused on my work. I only focused on my outstretched fist.


What would have to be loaded into this fist to knock down the cliff?


After a while, Kwon Ma, who had been watching, opened his mouth.


“What do you want to do?”


“Didn’t you tell Master Kwon that you wanted to learn martial arts?”


“Do you really want to be my disciple?”


“If you will accept it.”


Kwonma was startled. The son of Cheonma had never been a disciple of Majon.


“Are you serious?”


“Yes, I’m serious. I already have my father’s permission.”


“The leader gave permission?”


“You did.”


It was the moment when Kwon-ma realized that my determination was no joke.


“Do you know what kind of person I am and why are you doing this?”


“I don’t know for sure. But the moment you said that your goal was to knock down the cliff, I think I fell for you.”




Half sincerity and half flattery were being displayed.


“Do you think that trick will work? Do you think I will support you as my successor if you do this?”


“You don’t have to do it. No, don’t do it. I don’t know if you’ve heard the rumors about me, but my goal is to finish this successor selection without bloodshed between brothers. That’s why I feel more secure with you, Kwon Ma-nim. Kwon Ma-nim will prevent you from crossing the line.”


“Why do you think I’m stopping you?”


“Because you are the one who tries to tear down a cliff with your bare fists. You know very well that the moment you put dirty plots or schemes into those fists, you will never be able to tear down a cliff.”


“!”


“I think that the only person who can beat up my brother or me, who are going crazy over the fight for the successor, is you, Kwon Ma-nim. If my brother or I try to cross the line, please stop us. Please beat us without mercy with your fists.”


I didn’t avoid the unpleasant and vicious gaze directed at me. You’re crazy about martial arts? I’m just as crazy about something as you are about going down a single path.


Next moment!


Kwon Ma’s big fist was right in front of my face.


He threw his fist so quickly that there was not even a sound of wind. It was as if the fist had been there from the beginning, it was right in front of his face.


The next thing that came out was a loud noise.


WHHHHHHHHHHHHH!


I thought I heard a huge gust of wind coming from behind me.


Kwaaaaang!


There was a large hole in the wall far behind me.


Surprisingly, the fist stopped and completely blew my back while leaving my face intact. It was truly an amazing and noble technique.


Kwon-ma stared at me coldly, not even blinking at the flying fist, then turned around and left without saying a word.


I stood there and watched the back of him walking away into the distance.


The more you do this, the more the flame in my heart will burn fiercely.




At the end of the road, the horse stopped.


“Starting tomorrow, come to the Cheonggwon training center.”
