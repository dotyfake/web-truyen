A transparent sunlight seeped into the sky.


It is the time when the shadows of the crowd are the smallest.


People lying down on their mats, looking like beggars or ronin, masters of Boshin-gyeong standing with their arms crossed and their feet together on high tree branches, and even men, women, young and old sitting in palanquins with their escort warriors in silk clothes.


There was hardly a single person who looked bored. As the sun rose, the excitement on most of their faces grew darker.


and.


“It’s coming! It’s coming!”


“What? Finally… … !”


“Where are you? Who are you?!”


There was a serious air of tension filling the distant mountain path below. The sound of iron plates clashing at regular intervals was also heard. It gradually grew louder.


The crowd was buzzing like a swarm of bees.




“Sipjeonmun! The Heavenly King of Ten Thousand Armies has arrived! Leading his disciples!”


“You really did respond… I was hesitating… … .”


“The ten best martial artists in the world are displaying their martial arts skills during the Zhong Huan Shi…!”


“I will wash my eyes with Manjonghonwon Gong today.”


The leaders of the giant breakwaters are all people who are hard to see even if you live your whole life. This is true not only for the common people but also for the masters of martial arts with a certain level of fame.


The sun in the sky, which rarely appears unless it is in a suitable place, and even if it is on the same ground for a short while, it is difficult to see its appearance with the eyes.


It has even deeper meaning to the martial arts people.


There is a rumor that the hand gestures and footsteps of a peerless master contain a great deal of wisdom, and that just watching them for a moment can broaden your horizons and lead to great enlightenment.


“If I do this, I can see the King of Hwajungam? I heard that Songok and Ban-ak are crying and leaving!”


“I don’t think it’s that bad. Rumors tend to be exaggerated.”




“Get out of the way! I can’t see you! Get out of the way!”


“Stop pushing that! I can’t go any further!”


“The martial artists are setting up camp! If you go any further, you’ll get attacked, so stop…!”


Crowds of people packed the long ridge.


A scuffle broke out between the people.


Those who wanted to move forward even a little bit stuck their heads out, and those who couldn’t secure a view jumped up in place to get a glimpse of the highest peak.


Because it is an opportunity that will never come again in the world.


It is to witness the martial arts of peerless masters, and to be the first to inform each group of the results of today’s battle.


Countless people thought so.


Even if you can’t witness the fight properly, you have to keep your feet on the ground.




A historic site. It was a hundred times better than staring blankly at a cracked, uncultivated land.


How could I turn my back on the peerless masters whom I had only heard of through rumors and admired all my life?


Unlike the common people, the powerful men and high-ranking officials who had taken the best seats looked down and sighed.


“Ten Commandments… You really came… … .”


“It is truly a terrifying sight.”


A group of people climbing the hill with steady steps.


He wore armor that gleamed brightly in the sunlight.


A single metallic sound spread from the joints, and at first glance, the appearance of emitting a stern military discipline did not seem like that of a martial artist.


Clank. Clank.


About forty people walked in step with the ten-man warrior clad in creepy white armor. The invisible aerodynamic waves were enormous.


The energy waves flowing out along with the completely synchronized internal breath pressed down on the grass leaves.


Even though I’m just walking.


It had the same magnificence as the Beijing military expedition. It was a ceremony that only those with the same level of internal energy could perform.


“Just look at that appearance. You said you clashed with the Blood Flame Cult Leader, but you’ve been very active lately… … .”


“As expected, the Ten-Way Sword Master is still going strong. It seems that the rumor about how many of the Tang family’s treasures were destroyed is not a lie.”


“Sima Oedo’s friends are so arrogant. I’m not sure if the secret meeting will be successful if they keep going like this.”


“Yes? Why do you think so?”


“Most people in the martial arts world are usually ignorant of the world. That is, unless they are from a major faction.”


“hmm…….”


“How many swordsmen are there who would risk their lives without recognizing the famous martial artists? There will surely be those who step forward to show off to the Thirteen Heavens, which has become the mainstream. Those who are not well-versed in the principles, but are strong in their own way… For example, the sects under the Ten Commandments.”




“Ah! Now that I think about it, this matchup wasn’t set yet, was it?”


“Anyone can participate. An unknown punk who has sharpened his sword a bit can use insults as an excuse to attack Magwangikju with a sword. But those who are ignorant and incompetent won’t dare do so.”


“It doesn’t mean anything. They won’t even be able to handle the first attack of Magwangikju three times, let alone the Jangmunin of Ami and Cheongseong.”


“You think that Sima Weidao’s leader, Shilbirth Heaven, is just a strong man with a strong will. It’s not that they can’t fight a just war. Rather, they are skilled at playing around with their opponents. It’s the skill of making small sacrifices to gain big profits.”


“I really don’t understand what Elder Nangseong is talking about… … .”


“Just wait and see. In reality, the results of the non-combat are none of my concern. I should properly look at the Manjonghonwon-gong of the Ten-Tier Martial Arts Academy.”


While people from all walks of life look up.


The procession of ten soldiers led by Munju Manbyeongcheon-gun climbed the promised hill. In an instant, the clanging sound of metal suddenly stopped.


“It’s very spacious. I think I’ll be able to spread out my mind.”


The ten-year-old master muttered with a sad smile on his face.


He looked around and stroked the left side of his waist. He exuded the leisurely demeanor characteristic of the Absolute.


The subordinate next to him bowed his head slightly.


“It is called Gyeonghoebong Peak and Gyeonghoereung Tomb.”


“It’s a hill where stars gather. I didn’t know that there was a peak this high and wide in Sacheon.”


“This is the place where the dead Yongbongsangdok was buried… … .”

“Dragon and Phoenix Twin Poisons?”


“They are the direct descendants of the Tang family. They are the siblings who were offered as offerings to the Geumsimun Jinbeop that day.”


“Ah, I’ve enjoyed using names as a drinking snack. I’ve heard that the nicknames kids use these days are really exaggerated.”


The ten-year-old monk slowly nodded his head.


And then suddenly I turned my eyes.


“Of course… for a warrior of your caliber, it wouldn’t be funny to call him a dragon or a phoenix.”


It wasn’t something I said to my subordinates.


The ten experts who turned their gazes following Moonju flinched.


For a moment, the thick armor covering their bodies made a small noise. It was because their wide-open eyes could see the black, billowing hems of their clothes.


When did you arrive?


There was a faint glow breaking through the gaps in the bushes.


Saaaaa―


It falls into pieces and disappears at the feet of a young man standing in the middle of a hill.


It was clear that the light wave propulsion of the light aircraft was more mysterious than anyone else on the mountainside today.


At this moment, with the face of a young man giving off a dreamy feeling in the breaking sunlight.


The delicate Jeongyeonshin.


A lonely temperament was evident in his expressionless face.


“Magwangikju.”


One of the ten experts muttered as if he was groaning.


In an instant, a huge cheer erupted from the crowd surrounding the mountainside. For a moment, even the atmosphere seemed to shake violently.




Waaaa …


“When on earth…? What kind of nerve is this…?”


“That appearance… It’s the King of Hwajungam! I guess the rumors were lacking!”


“That was the kind of constitutional ledger that was?”


“I’m in love with you! Just look at me once!”


“I’m really opening my eyes today!”


People were very excited and were waving their hands and screaming.


The heat was intense. This was because copies of the Tang Dynasty’s royal proclamation were posted throughout Sichuan Province.


He made words that no one dared imagine into words and posted them all over the world, staking his supreme status as the Black Emperor of the Yellow Emperor.


The host of the Non-Mu Festival.


The youngest leader of the Shingeomdan.


The great monk who gave Mancheonhwawoo to the Tang family.


With several widely known achievements, there is hardly anyone in Sacheon Province who does not know the name Jeong Yeon-shin.


The rumor that the Tang clan, the largest aristocrat in Sacheon, would take him as their teacher also won their favor. It was obvious who the majority of the crowd would side with.


But none of the parties involved in the conflict cared about that. Their fate was determined by their martial arts skills.


Sling.


As the ten-man sergeant touched his wrist, the pure white iron elbow gauntlet made a desolate sound.


“Why?”


He asked.


“What.”




Jeong Yeon-shin’s answer was insincere.


Because I was worried that the Baekyak situation would arrive first, I quickly cast the Ten-Li Light Effect, but in the end, I couldn’t even see the hair of the Golden Shimunju.


‘What is their intention?’


At that moment, the ten-pronged swordsman tore the mouth left and right.


“It’s different from what was written on the door. Where are the two? Monk Baekyak and the young Malko from Cheongseong.”


“Bring the two from your side first.”


“I asked first. You answer.”


The ten-year-old man smiled faintly and said, “It was very sad.


Jeong Yeon-shin swallowed the words, “Sunmaryeon’s return letter” and “Geumsimun’s dull head” in her heart. Everyone was watching.


If you lower your opponent, he will not be able to rise. Here, you must show your innate dignity to suppress the scum of the Sima-Oedo.


He spoke slowly, his voice coming from his heart.


“You live off the backs of the common people, yet you still think you’re a great general? A mere traitor is acting like he’s high up in the ranks.”


“Are you talking to me?”


“You don’t know shame.”


Jeong Yeon-shin concluded her speech with a decisive tone.


He didn’t wait for a proper answer. He had been good at asking and answering questions on his own since childhood, and it was very rare for him to get satisfactory answers from others.


It was the same when he came out to the world of martial arts. He had a deep innate insight.


‘Let’s start by winning from interest.’


There is no way that Sunmaryeonju and Geumsimunju will not attend. They will be watching from somewhere.


At this moment, like the eldest son of Cheongseong and Ami, who is observing the progress of the two thirteen heavenly states.




“Come.”


Jeong Yeon-shin said.


“Well, it was quite disappointing at the party.”


The face of the sage, with one eyebrow raised, regained its composure.


“It wouldn’t be a bad idea to properly compare martial arts skills here.”


Damn it.


He took a step forward. At the same time, the momentum of his rise pushed away the surroundings.


That was when.


“It’s not the right level!”


A martial artist climbed up the hill with a thud. He was wearing a martial arts helmet.


He looked to be middle-aged.


The scar running diagonally across his face was impressive, and the faint haze blooming around his body was also intense. It was a tyrannical self-defense weapon.


“Cheoljong Horse Fist!”


On one side, some of the crowd shouted.


It didn’t stop there, because it wasn’t just one person.


Boom! Boom!


“No matter how high the rank of the Imperial Palace’s black hierarchy, how could someone who is ultimately nothing more than a mere military lord dare… … .”


“The opponent is the head of the Daemun sect. You are not qualified.”


A man holding a large axe laughs heartily, and a woman holding a narrow-pointed sword speaks decisively.


They were all surrounded by strong waves.




Wow!


The shouts of the crowd were mixed with the strong wind blowing.


Jang-geuk-bu-wol (殘極腐鉞) Hyeong-gi-jung (邢企重), Chal-ma-geom (紮魔劍) Hye-so (慧蔬). These are names that Jeong Yeon-shin had heard at least once when he came from Sacheon.


It was said that he was one of the strongest among the Sima Wei sects that did not belong to the Daebangpa.


“I feel embarrassed.”


The ten-year-old sage smiled and stepped back.


When a peerless master of Sima Weidao appears, there are those who make him their leader, act as if they are strong, and engage in plunder. They are not his disciples, but mountain men.


Among them, those who were particularly strong were called the giant demons of Sima Weido. This literally meant big devils.


It is a disaster caused by the absolute ruler of Sima Oedo. Among the people, they are considered more fearsome than the thirteen heavenly lords.


bad year.


Although it is difficult for the Ip Hwang Seong to fill the ranks of the Shingum Dan, it is very easy for the Sapa absolutes to create followers and guests.


Even if the peerless master dies, it is very rare for Saphain to return to the council.


“They call us a bunch of monkeys, so let’s have a quick fist fight. I’ll apply for a life-or-death duel.”


Cheoljongma Kwon continued speaking, bumping his two fists together.


“Didn’t you call us too, Ma Gwang-ik-ju? Judging from the door, you seem to be impatient because you can’t catch the Dongdo from Sacheon Land who are walking the path of injustice.”


Sabak.


He moved slowly to the side, taking light steps, so that he could step back at any time.


“… … .”


Jeong Yeon-shin didn’t answer. She just stared blankly at the ten-man gate over the shoulders of the three horses.


A sad line was drawn between the lips of the ten-year-old expert.


“What should I do? If Magwangikju leaves here, I have to get off here according to the rules of the Non-Woo Jeon… .”


Sima Oedo’s trick.


The long sword fights of the best swordsmen are not fought in a continuous manner. Even the sword fights that are used to strengthen friendship are like that.


Since countless vested interests and justifications are intertwined, anything that could become a variable or cause controversy later must be eliminated.


Because the presence of each and every person weighs as much as the world.


“They have their chance too. They are not my subordinates, so I can’t say anything. Of course, if you want to send another expert to fight them, that’s fine too. Since it’s a matter of life and death, you’ll have to risk your life… … .”


“Great. Anything else?”


“You were the one who pointed out all the Sima Yi paths in the first place, so it’s not like it’s something particularly petty… Hmm?”


It was when the ten-year-old master raised his eyebrows.


In Jeongyeonshin’s mind, who met his eyes.


‘Seonryong.’


A dragon stood up, holding a fan in its mouth, then coiled the sword at its waist tightly.


The moment after that, the divine sword Yeore let out a clear sound.


slowly.


“… … !”


A single layer of horizontal lines stretched out beyond the ridge. It was colorless, without any color.


Boooo …


There, following the light of the light that flashed in a straight line, a line of blood was engraved on the necks of the three horsemen. It was a complete moment.


The self-defense equipment of the giants was torn apart by the lightning-like blades of the lightning, and the corpses fell to the side with only their heads flying off, making the sound of a piece of paper being torn.


Immediately afterwards, the divine sword Yeo-rae returned, drawing a beautiful trajectory.


Sling-


Jeong Yeon-shin placed one hand on the sword of the lightning that was inserted very gently. When she slightly raised her eyelids, she saw the face of the ten-man swordsman with a dumbfounded expression.


“You bastard, you were planning on doing this from the beginning… … .”


The guy said. Jeongyeonshin slowly opened her lips.


“Let’s continue the showdown.”


“What?”


“How can you call Mihu a human?”
