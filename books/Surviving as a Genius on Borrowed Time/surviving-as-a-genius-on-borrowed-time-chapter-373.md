\* \* \*


The masters of the world who have reached a high level of study are usually big eaters.


It’s not just because he uses his powerful energy through martial arts. It’s because food is a natural purification of the body.


Just as those who have grown up preciously or practitioners of Buddhism digest the spirit dan with their energy, the masters of Naegigong who have achieved the great heavenly circuit of true qi treat every meal as a small elixir.


A meal that leads to a rigorous burning. Burning everything without leaving behind even a single scrap.


This was the reason why super experts appeared even in the harsh seas where it was difficult to obtain elixirs.


‘Still, we need to leave some nutrients to maintain our strength… … .’


Jeongyeonshin sat in the cozy guest room and thought.


A room where the unique scent of a temple gently flows.


A very skinny nun was looking at Jeongyeonshin with eyes that were difficult to fathom.




On her left and right sat three old monks who looked to be of similar age.


The monks of Ami. All of them were nuns.


―How old is he… I didn’t know that the King of Hwajungam was this young. They even say that he had turned around and time had passed.


– Rumor has it that he is around ten and seventeen. He is not even of age.


―I mean, non-combatant. Isn’t that too much of a burden for the young lord? No matter how high your status and martial arts are, to stand among the leaders of the great sects… It’s truly a shame.


-You seem to have compassion. What Samae said is right.


―I am concerned about the words and actions of the long-suffering private. He rarely speaks in a roundabout way… … .


―I heard that the youngest black person in Ip Hwang Seong has my grandfather’s blood in him. He is a traitor.


A soft aerodynamic wave brushes Jeongyeonshin’s ears and subsides like a sigh.


The monks’ transmission of sound. Originally, they were whispers sealed in the air waves following the strict transmission of sound, but Jeongyeonshin’s upper chamber was able to unravel their true energy structure without much effort and interpret them in his mind.




It’s the upper body’s fault.


Unlike his master’s personality, he was curious. It was not what Jeongyeonshin intended. It was clearly that way.


‘The problem is the Baekhoehyeol.’


Rather, Jeong Yeon-shin was worried about the eldest member of the Amipa clan who was sitting silently in front of her.


A body that looked like flesh had been added to the bones. It was a contrast to the slender bodies of the Shaolin monks I had met so far. Even considering his age, which was well over sixty, he was too emaciated.


That was when.


Suddenly, Baekyak Sidae opened his mouth.


“Do you have something to say?”


Unlike his skinny appearance, his voice was firm. The amount of energy he had stored inside was so great that even the atmosphere shook for a moment.


Only then did Jeong Yeon-shin notice the seal stamped on the forehead of the leader of the Amipa clan. Nine. Those red spots symbolized the status of the highest monk in the land of Sacheon.




It was said that the only monks in the martial arts world with the same number of precepts were the Shaolin abbot and the chief priest of the Saeoe Podalap Palace.


A true and undisputed master of the political party.


“Didn’t you call me, monk? Please ask me.”


Jeong Yeon-shin responded politely. This was because he saw his opponent as an old monk, not the absolute ruler of martial arts.


While the surrounding monks flinched slightly, Baekyak Satae opened his mouth with an expressionless face.


“I asked because I was curious about the poet’s thoughts.”


“… … ?”


“No-nap has made up his mind. Jeong Si-ju is not the right person for this non-combat mission.”


“Why is that so?”


Jeongyeon Shin straightened her back slightly.


I had heard the monks talk about his age earlier, but his shoulders were incomparably wider than before his transformation, proving that he was an adult.


“Just a moment ago, I felt a faint sense of energy flowing out from outside. It was surprisingly auspicious.”


“Is it because of the golden phoenix?”


Baekyak Satae nodded slightly.


“Things that people perceive as auspicious have something in common in nature, whether it be the power of Buddha or the energy of a spiritual being. If there were no similarities, it would be difficult to lump them together and say that they are auspicious.”


“I guess so.”


“The Chicheon Yongsal Gong is a divine technique that destroys the energy of the Pasa Hyeonjeong. Its secret technique lies in slaughtering the Jiao Dragon, so anyone with divine powers should definitely avoid the Geumsimunju.”


The Golden Hour’s Chicheon Yongsalgong.


The words that Jeong Yeon-shin had heard so often were similar to those of the Amipa leader.


A martial art created to catch and kill the dragon, which can be considered the pinnacle of spiritual beings. Even Baekyak Satae is a person who has directly dealt with Geumsimunju.




“The golden crowned Avalokiteshvara’s energy was shattered by three kicks. So I used the tiger palm technique, but she put her hands together. She didn’t even give me time to build up my balance.”


She spoke softly.


“That was the Byeoncheon Chamryongsik. In an instant, a thunderous clap occurred, and No-nap’s self-defense energy was completely ripped off.”


“The main temple next door was also blown away. It was as if it had been hit by a fireball… … .”


An old monk sitting next to me added:


If it is the Amipa’s main temple, it is the Manbuljeon (Ten Thousand Buddhas Hall).


It was a very historic place.


Because the number of small Buddha statues is hard to count, people from outside Sacheon flock to the temple to pay their respects.


At the same time, it was famous for its size, rivaling that of a palace.


“The Cheoncheon Chamryongsik of Geumsimunju, who has accumulated internal energy through the Chicheon Yongsalgong, is a martial art that originally breaks the scales of a dragon. Nonap has greatly experienced its power this time.”


“… … .”


“It is not acceptable for someone who has mastered the internal energy of the Buddha to accept it. This is a fact known to the world, so no one can find fault with the young lord avoiding the Golden Gate Master. I have already finished speaking with the long-suffering jinin of Cheongseong, so I hope that the lord will watch Bimu’s progress and take on someone other than the Golden Gate Master.”


Jeongyeonshin was silent for a moment.


There was no unimpressive sect among the old ones, but this was the first time they were treated so young. Even though they now look like adults.


‘The monks of Ami are kind.’

It seemed as if the resolve to take revenge on Suncheon Ikju Ha Do-un was momentarily released.


However, Geumsimunju, who practiced human sacrifice in a literal way, must die by his hand.


“… … .”


While Baekyak Satae was watching him intently, the monks on his left and right exchanged incessant messages.


They were all saying that they were curious.


Given the nature of Jang Moon Sa-jeo, he should have stopped talking at first, but it was very strange that he was trying to convince Ma Gwang-ik-ju like this.


It was along with the words that she was curious about the energy she had felt from Ma Gwang-ik-ju earlier.


Suddenly, Baekyak Sidae opened his mouth.


“You have a stubborn face.”


“This is a non-profit organization that I organized.”


Jeong Yeon-shin answered calmly.


“I know that you have interfered with the work of Geumsimunju. If the Lord takes the initiative and steps forward first, Sipmunju and Sunmaryeonju will surely take a step back. You should call Geumsimunju.”


The Baekyak situation spoke. It was a decisive tone.


Jeongyeonshin tilted her head inwardly.


“I only stole one tactic, it wasn’t something that was difficult or big.”


“Wasn’t that the magic circle of the dragon?”


“There was no defense against destruction. It must have been a minor matter. Or they could have quickly prepared a different formation.”


“… Nonap has not seen how she treats her mortal enemy.”


“If what the monk says is true, who can stand against Geumsimunju? The Taoists of Cheongseong are famous for incorporating Taoist power into their sword techniques.”


Jeongyeonshin asked. It meant that it would be the same no matter which one of them came forward.




Swish.


Baekyak Satae rolled a large prayer bead on his finger. His face was indifferent. He had the appearance of a sect’s absolute ruler.


“I think No-nap will come out.”


“… … ?”


“This time, the Bimuje is not a consecutive victory. Even if No-nap is killed by Geumsimunju, he can still break the spearhead of the Sa-pa group.”


Saying that he would give up his own life. This is not something that a senior member of the old school, who is expected to live a long life with the traditional Baekdo martial arts, would hear. Jeong Yeon-shin’s eyes drooped.


“Are you saying that we should give and receive the lives of both sides?”


“The Ip Hwang Seong is clashing with many of the Thirteen Heavenly Beings, and recently, even the famine has become severe. As a result, the behavior of Sima Weidao has gone too far… If we do not cut off the pulse here, the living beings of the Four Heavenly Beings will have to endure unsolvable suffering for the rest of their lives.”


The path of destruction and destruction of the world.


At this moment, Baekyak Sae-tae was Kang Ho-in. He was accepting this life-or-death battle as a major event that would determine the fate of this land.


“Your Majesty, please understand. The reason why No-nap was defeated by Geumsi-munju was not simply because of his own weak martial arts skills. Regardless of their compatibility, these eyes clearly contain Geumsi-munju’s divine skills.”


“… … .”


“There is no chance of winning. The old being must go first.”


The old monk’s voice filled the room with silence.


Even though there was no aerodynamic force, the feeling of weight was like the spirituality of someone who had completed the divine technique shaking the air.


The eldest of the Ami factions among the old factions.


His studies are incredibly deep. He must have achieved great success.


No matter how many times he fights, he always loses at least once. Even the current Jeong Yeon-shin would have a hard time guaranteeing a ten percent chance of winning.


“I’ll ask you again now.”


Baekyak Satae continued speaking slowly. If he felt his own inaction, wouldn’t it be right to agree with that opinion?




“When you first saw No-nap, what did you think?”


She thought.


The young resident came face to face with the elder brother of the old family.


It was our first meeting.


Anyone can’t help but feel a huge wall. Even among the best experts who are on the same level, this is the case.


The intricately built up martial arts that Ma Gwang-ik-ju Jeong Yeon-shin has accumulated to reach today’s level are giving Baek-yak the feeling of facing a wall at this moment.


He is a peerless master who has polished his skills to the extreme. There is no way that lies will work.


There was only one possible answer.


Jeongyeonshin carefully opened her mouth while looking into the old monk’s clear eyes.


“You need to strengthen your muscles and take care of your body… … .”


“… … ?”


While Baekyak Satae slowly blinked his eyes.


Jeong Yeon-shin felt somewhat relieved. She was finally able to talk about what had bothered her. Before the important military ceremony.


“If you are a long-legged monk of the Army, you are someone the people can rely on. But the sides of your back are very narrow. Isn’t it true that you are supporting your lower back with your internal energy rather than your muscles?”


“… No-nap’s internal energy is like the river water of Mount Sumeru… … .”


“I don’t feel much energy from Jang Yo-geun either. You shouldn’t live like that. There must be a warrior’s skill in Ami’s martial arts, and I’m worried that if you turn your waist, something unpleasant might happen. Are you eating enough beans? I’ve always wanted to ask.”


Woof-


There were things that surged into Jeongyeonshin’s mind like a torrent.


It was a long-awaited inspiration. It was very bright.


How could a body made up of nothing more than thread-like muscles be able to withstand the martial arts of Geumsimunju?




How can someone with low strength withstand a blow so powerful it could shatter dragon scales?


Judging from the Baekyak incident, it seems like they managed to escape without any fatal injuries.


‘The blood vessels through which the aerodynamic force is emitted must have been used very fluidly. Other than that, there’s nothing else. Because the muscles are worthless.’


Come to think of it, even the peerless swordsman Gogeom of the Mudang faction fought against Geumsimunju and survived.


‘The monk has gone beyond Samhwachwijeong and achieved Gongwolmu. It would be better to use the internal energy’s pushing and striking waves rather than just simple footwork. It is a technique that uses the footwork inward rather than toward the opponent, making the body movements much faster and more flexible… ‘


A guess close to a prediction.


A short but thick accumulation of knowledge.


There were things that collided with each other and interlocked like lightning. In the midst of all this, Jeong Yeon-shin’s words did not stop.


Because I felt sorry for the appearance of the great monk who had deeply cultivated his Buddhist power.


“It’s not just your waist that you should be concerned about. The shoulder joint point (肩髎穴) that is attached to the triangle-shaped muscle on the shoulder is also a problem. The secret of the martial arts is fundamentally rotation, but how did you withstand the strong blow with such thin muscles… It seems like you have mastered a very difficult task. If I were to guess, when the power of the Geumsimunju’s footwork reaches its peak at the point of impact, according to the principle of water-extreme-pil-ban… … ”


Jeong Yeon-shin’s words and actions were full of sincerity. I felt it as I stood before him, facing him from afar, as a peerless master who had honed his upper-body skills to the limit.


within.


A thin solid line was engraved on the mouth of the Baekyak incident.
