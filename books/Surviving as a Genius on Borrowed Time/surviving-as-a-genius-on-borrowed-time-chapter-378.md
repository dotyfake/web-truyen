Jeong Yeon-shin expanded her sharp sense of tension in all directions.


The lines created by all kinds of weapons touched my skin with a tingling sensation, and the techniques of using them in reverse formed a brilliant picture in my head.


The eyes of the ten experts grew wide.


Phew!


Jeong Yeon-shin, who had been rotating the spear of the Bangcheonhwageuk with one hand, smoothly turned her waist.


A long spear of considerable length naturally extended backwards in a long trajectory.


Phew!


There was a strong shockwave. The abdomen of one of the Ten Masters who was rushing from behind was pierced.


A furrow that ran wildly, digging through the dirt below. A translucent wind scattered from the spear that pierced the bastard’s back. Anyone could see that it was a spear strike.


Jeongyeonshin narrowed her eyebrows slightly and thought. Grandma Ak was sharper.




[That spear strike, mine… …!]


[What happened?]


Jeong Yeon-shin let go of the spear and immediately grabbed the axe that fell from the sky and threw it forward.


From the palm of his hand that had let go of the axe handle, a colorless flame burst out as a propulsion wave, and immediately the head of the ten-man warrior holding the shield exploded.


bang-!


The ground was torn apart in all directions by the strong shockwave. Shards of shattered rock shot up like shells.


[what……?!]


It was when the thoughts of the remaining men converged into shock.


Jeong Yeon-shin focused her light energy towards the Yongcheon point of Balchi. She spun around in place, riding the wind with her entire body.


The encirclement made up of the ten great men was already in a state of despair. Even Sima Wei, the leader of the Thirteen Heavenly Kings, was like that.




Gongwolmu.


It means that it is the last resort that he has. In fact, it was the first time that Jeong Yeon-shin had been pushed back like this since experiencing a complete transformation.


If you destroy this defense here, you win. It’s like receiving the ten-year-old’s punishment.


Kwaaaaang!


I struck the one guy’s phrase with my palm. At the same time, Jeongyeonshin used my internal power technique.


The tension in the ring was transferred to the bastard’s hand by forcing it into each phrase.


The surrounding dust split left and right like waves, and the hand of the man holding the phrase twitched.


Again, Geumnasu. He took the iron whip and swung it around in reverse, then threw it at the sword-wielding Ten-Minute Master and tied him up tightly.


The club in his other hand was then swung in a spectacular counter-movement and struck another bastard in the eye.


Oh my!




A short vibration went up to my elbow. It was very strong. The sealing technique was properly deployed. The new form of the one who was hit rippled like a wave.


[Ugh!]


The ten most important martial arts techniques of bare-handed fighting. The body that could be considered the foundation hesitated and groaned.


It seemed like the overlapping blows on the original spirit had penetrated the main body. This must have been because it had led to the spirit.


[How dare Aesongi… …!]


Jeongyeon Shin regenerated her body again and faced the men rushing at her.


Percussion-


I caught the spear that was coming at me. It wasn’t difficult.


It was because he had created the exact same wave of force, the exact same form, with his hand. There was no resistance.


He slashed the spear aside. The neck of the one who had been swinging his hook from behind was pierced there. The atmosphere exploded violently.


[This can’t be happening… This can’t be happening!]


The bare-handed Ten-Way Master burst into a blast of energy. It was a stream of internal energy that continued towards Gongwolmu’s clones.


Suddenly, Jeong Yeon-shin’s eyes caught sight of a face distorted with embarrassment.


He stepped towards the bastard again, his new form leaving an afterimage behind him.


This is because the colorless aerodynamic waves generated by the body became incredibly dense, and it moved at a much faster speed than that.


It was a heteromorphic system.


[… … !]


A dull and slow space, like being in a swamp, but a place where time moves on a different axis than the outside because it is a realm of super-ascension.


Jeongyeonshin’s eyes turned around quickly, flashing blue light.


All the weapons that came close to cutting and destroying his body fanned the flames of inspiration that had arisen like sparks.




Understand! Jeez! Kwaaaaaaaang―!


Hundreds of lines were intertwined.


Jeongyeonshin took all the weapons held by the ten masters as her own.


It was as if he was completely possessed. There was no gap between the herbivores and the herbivores that should have existed.


He would grab the flying spear and swing it down, deflect the blow to stab someone else, and then grab the sword, axe, or staff and stab it in a complex trajectory at someone else.


Each time, the ground on the peak would thump and fall downward.


The afterimages of his body were scattered in all directions. Following the trajectories of the dozens of throws he made, a huge ball of light was carved into the air.


And finally.


It was the presence of the real Ten Commandments.


The scattered remains of Jeongyeonshin gathered in one place, and his hand touched the abdomen of Sipjeonmunju.


The strong winds of the Hwan River were swirling in two layers in the center of the room. The ground was scraped noisily with a crunching sound.


“It’s done now.”


[what……?!]


“There’s nothing to see in Baekta.”


Kwaaaa …

——————





A loud noise, as if lightning had struck the ground. The dirt floor rose dozens of feet high like a tidal wave, engulfing the surrounding area.


Immediately afterwards, the new form of the Ten-Way Martial Arts Sword was shot out at lightning speed, and fragments of the self-defense weapon scattered from his entire body and mixed with the dust.


Like a cluster of stars faintly filling the hazy clouds.


“… … .”


The silence of the crowd, which had been as if frozen, grew thicker.


Not a single one of them moved, not even on the distant peaks or among those lined up along the nearby mountain paths.


The masters, standing on high tree branches with their arms folded, froze in place, and those sitting in palanquins with silk canopies spread out as if they were at a banquet stopped fanning themselves.


Even though the movements of the peerless masters were like rays of light, the flow of the martial arts could be guessed.


It was thanks to the ten-pronged sword that he often hesitated at the end of a fight.


Saaaaa―


Smoke thickly enveloped the hills.


A cloud seemed to cover the peak. Here and there, words began to appear.


At that moment, the air was filled with cries of what to do because there was no sign of any results.


bang!


A huge cloud of dust was tossed away like a whirlwind. It was the recoil of a pure white divine sword flying across the sky and being stuck in the scabbard of the Demon Sword Master.


The dust in all directions was pushed away and disappeared like ripples spreading across the surface of a lake.


A stark spectacle was revealed.


Magwangikju, with one hand on the sword of the divine sword, stared blankly ahead. Even though blood was dripping from various parts of his body, he did not look gruesome.


The reason was that the appearance of long, jet-black hair reminded one of the nobles of the Blood Flame Cult.


On the other side, a ten-legged scorpion lay with its limbs stretched out.




The armor that was almost a symbol was taken off. The fragments of armor scattered around were gleaming in the sunlight.


The new soldier who had not lost his shine even when covered in dirt was shattered into pieces.


That was one of them.


No more clones were seen.


Cough!


The panacea master vomited blood while lying down. It was a sight that silenced those who witnessed it.


“Is it over? I thought the heavenly gods were fighting… … .”


“Hey! What’s going on?”


“…Magwangikju is standing alone.”


“The King of Hwajungam has won!”


“Surely not, the Manbyeongcheon Army… …!”


While the seats lined up in the front were as quiet as a mouse, the rear, where it was difficult to clearly see the battlefield, gradually became chaotic.


Rather, the high-ranking officials at the front came to their senses in the chaos.


“Jeon Seo-eung, Jeon Seo-eung, bring me one! Are there three left?!”


“How can a newbie, Ma Gwang-ik-ju, who is not even the leader of the Mystery Islands… …!”


“Prepare to send a hawk to Yangyang’s Iphwangseong nature. Second… No, this isn’t the first or second time this has happened. The first child would be good.”


“Wake up. You are the successor, so you must not lose your mind here. Tell me what kind of waves the defeat of that ten-professional master will bring to the Sacheon Sanggye.”


A huge uproar spread like wildfire.


Still, few people took the step hastily.


Even though the ramifications of the outcome of the war were enormous, the war was only just ending.




A huge crowd of people stood still, muttering all sorts of words.


Beep-


In many places, birds that resembled hawks or falcons flew up, chirping.


The master of Sima Wei Dao, Thirteen Heavenly King, was defeated by the great lord of Iphwangseong. It was an event that shook the world of martial arts.


“A mere black guy came all the way here.”


The Ten Heavenly Lord who had been lying down slowly opened his mouth. He was not looking at Jeongyeonshin, but at the distant sun. Thirteen Heavenly Lords are transcendent beings.


Even at this moment, the jet-black energy rippling in his eyes allowed him to look straight into the sunlight.


“This is truly incredible.”


He said.


The best cure for all diseases.


The energy waves throughout my body are gradually fading away, but my internal breathing is still deep.


So much so that the voice barely breaks off even though it is coming out of a throat filled with blood.


Jeongyeon Shin stared at him blankly and then opened her lips.


“I should have expected it.”


“…What?”


“These insects that eat the people’s food have even harmed the original unmanned forces. This is not a martial arts.”


“Then what is it?”


“The punishment of the country.”


“Ha…! Should I have expected the punishment?”


The ten-year-old expert burst into laughter.




“Isn’t this nonsense from the start? No matter how powerful the Shingeomdan is, it’s divided into seventeen equal parts.


“If the Gangho Martial Arts Factions join forces just a little, they can avoid the danger of extinction and even pose a threat. So, if they have peerless masters, they will have no choice but to take you lightly.”


“The corpse’s tongue is long.”


Jeong Yeon-shin dismissed the guy’s protest. Her voice was calm. Sip Mun-ju couldn’t open his mouth any longer.


“… … .”


“Just die now.”


Did those words reach you like a mantra?


slowly.


The ten-year-old’s breathing stopped. The invisible energy waves that had been spreading thickly throughout his body also subsided as if it were a lie.


A corpse was left behind.


“Your Majesty!”


“General, General!”


The ten-man army below rushed forward, their armor clanking. Jeong Yeon-shin paid no attention.


The first priority was to kill the remaining thirteen heavenly lords. It was a situation where I had to conserve my strength.


at that time.


“Magwangikju!”


One of the men who was examining the body of the Ten Commandments shouted. His face was full of resentment as he raised his head. There was venom in his eyes.


“We are not the main text!”


“… … ?”


“Aren’t you curious? Where have the many mountain sects under the command of the main text, Sunmaryeon, and Geumsimun gone? Where have the Yeollyeong and Paegeomjong groups who joined hands with the main text been active? Why hasn’t anyone shown up… …!”




The guy who was spouting words as if he was possessed by anger got hit on the back of his neck and fell down. It was the person sitting next to me who appeared to be a classmate.


“I apologize to Magwangikju. You are the clear winner of this battle.”


Provide an example with lottery tickets.


“We will now go down and retrieve the body of the deceased.”


Jeong Yeon-shin, who had been staring at him blankly, turned around. He had been questioned thirteen thousand times. Even if questioned, he would not tell any more.


But I was counting the time in my heart. If Sunmaryeonju or Geumsimunju didn’t show up, I was planning to get off the mountain right away.


He opened his mouth, carrying a lightbulb on his neck.


[The next traitor comes forward.]


Hwaak-


A gust of wind, constantly wafting up and down the hill, rose up, carrying with it the leaves. The ends of the blood-stained black robes fluttered roughly.


\* \* \*


The masters of the Cheongseongpa and Amipa were hiding in a cave in a nearby cliff.


The disciples who followed the ten-pronged swordsmanship were far from elite masters, and in the case of Sunmaryeon and Geumsimun, they never showed themselves. They couldn’t afford to get hit in the back of the head.


Gugu Palace―


However, even the old school masters, known as the immortals and bodhisattvas, could not escape the aftermath of the Bimu ritual.


The crowd above was stamping their feet and making a fuss, so we had to tip over some rubble.


It was madness.


“Magwangikju really won. I can’t believe it.”


“It’s strange. At that age, such an accomplishment can only be attributed to the incarnation of Bodhidharma… .”


“It’s definitely not as good as what I’ve seen in the Han-China Martial Arts Alliance. I guess we should consider it as another purple one appearing in Iphwangseong.”


Every word was filled with shock and despair.


It’s a conversation between young scholars. Cheongseongpa Jeokunryong, Ami’s golden priestess, and Jeomchang’s Sogeomhu were together.


“… … .”


The elders of Cheongseong and Ami sat cross-legged at the entrance to the cave and remained silent.


It was only when the air that quietly brushed against the asbestos caressed the hem of their shoulders and clothes.


“situation.”


A young man with sharp ears like blades and a white robe, the head of the Cheongseongpa, caused the Baekyak incident. She, the head of the Ami, turned her head.


“Speak.”


“I will participate in the next match.”


“The young lord will not tolerate it. Although that lord has a very gentle heart, his determination is sharp.”


“Children should listen to adults. This is the law and order of the world.”


“Ira. On the surface, isn’t there no young man as devout as I am?”


Cheongseong Jangmunin did not answer.


The ten-pronged swordsmanship was demoted. The magic swordsmanship of Iphwangseong was more than enough to fulfill his role.


If you defeat the Thirteen Heavenly Lords in succession there, you will gain truly overwhelming fame, but you cannot afford to lose your life just because of a slight possibility.


That was when.


Hwaaaa …


A spine-chilling energy seeped into the cave. For a moment, it seemed as if the heavens and the earth had become dark. It was an overwhelming magical energy.


It appeared suddenly.


“It’s pure magic! Disciples, come to the fortune!”


“Never open your mouth!”


The Bimu Battleground. The hill of Misan Unhoebong seen in the distance.


An old man wearing a pitch-black robe was striding up the mountain, cutting through the fog.


Dark footprints were left on the dirt floor, and even though they were hundreds of feet away, an ominous aura spread. It was as if it was suffocating me.


Kugu Palace.


Black aerodynamic waves occasionally blocked out the sunlight. The sky darkened and flickered.


The master of the previous generation of pure magicians.


He appeared to be the incarnation of the King of Hell. His very presence forced the crowd into silence.


The head of the Cheongseongpa clan stood up like a painting. Blue and red energies alternately rippled from the hem of his robe.


“Okay, I’ll take my leave now.”


“hmm…….”


Ma Gwang-ik-ju, who was suddenly faced with Sunmaryeon-ju, looked very dangerous.


Unlike the old man’s magic that swept through like a natural disaster, the young man just stood there blankly, looking around.


[You dared to call me Mihu. That’s why you’re standing here so disrespectfully.]


“Old man, welcome back.”


[Your judgment is ridiculous. Do you think I am on the same level as the fallen imperial prince?]


The magic contained in the voice of the Pure Marian sect shakes in all directions.


The word magnificent was fitting. There was no stopping the powerful waves.


“I have something to tell you.”


The moment when Ma Gwang-ik-ju finished speaking.


Woof!


The eighteen weapons that had been lying on the hill rose into the air all at once.


A familiar sight to the crowd. All the weapons rotated on their own, slowly surrounding the Magwangikju and Sunmalyeonju.


It was a strange harmony.


I couldn’t tell if it was the magic of Mancheonhwawoo or the magic of Eogum.


Dismissal – Dismissal –


Between the large circles drawn by the blades, auspicious white light flashed. The rays of light that passed here and there and disappeared repeatedly looked like lightning.


When several monks of the Amitabha sect who were watching the scene from the cliff chanted the Buddhist mantra, “Amitabha,” Sunmarinju opened her mouth.


“… Let’s assume I’m right.”


Sabak.


The Cheongseongpa leader paused just before kicking off the ground and jumping.
