# Absolute Regression Chapter 453 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Joo Hyang-wol cảm thấy an toàn khi ở bên cạnh cha của Geommugeuk, giống như khi cô ở trong vòng tay của cha mình. Cô nhận ra mình chưa cảm ơn Geom Woo-jin vì đã đứng ra dàn xếp thỏa thuận. Geom Woo-jin đáp lại một cách nhẹ nhàng, khiến cô cảm thấy an tâm. Geommugeuk nhận thấy sự khác biệt trong cách Joo Hyang-wol nhìn cha mình. Anh trêu chọc cha mình, nhưng Geom Woo-jin không phủ nhận điều đó. Geommugeuk giới thiệu cha mình và Hwi với Joo Hyang-wol. Anh dùng tên giả là Geommu, và tự nhận mình sẽ biến mất như khói. Anh giới thiệu cha mình là một người tàn nhẫn và Hwi là chú của anh. Hwi có vẻ bối rối khi được giới thiệu như vậy, nhưng Geom Woo-jin lại tỏ ra hài lòng.

Joo Hyang-wol cảm thấy thoải mái ở nơi này, nhưng cũng lo lắng về tình hình hiện tại. Cô sợ khi trở về, mẹ cô sẽ không tin tưởng cô và trách mắng vì đã giao thỏa thuận quan trọng cho một người lạ. Geommugeuk khuyên cô nên trở về và chuẩn bị cho cuộc chiến, vì kẻ thù đã lộ diện. Anh hiểu rằng mẹ cô có thể không tin cô, vì cha mẹ thường nhớ về những lỗi lầm thời trẻ của con cái. Anh khuyên cô nên nói chuyện với mẹ, thay vì cố gắng thuyết phục bà. Geommugeuk kể rằng ngay cả cha anh cũng không tin anh. Geom Woo-jin bất ngờ nói với Joo Hyang-wol đừng tin Geommugeuk.

Geommugeuk bảo Joo Hyang-wol viết ra những điều cần nói và cách thuyết phục mẹ cô. Anh hỏi cô đã bao giờ hỏi han mẹ chưa, và khuyên cô nên trò chuyện thay vì thuyết phục. Joo Hyang-wol nhận ra mình chỉ tập trung vào lỗi lầm của mẹ và nhớ về cha mình. Cô quyết định không trốn tránh nữa, và cảm ơn Geommugeuk cùng Geom Woo-jin. Trước khi rời đi, cô hỏi liệu có thể tìm thấy nơi an toàn nhất trong giới võ lâm bất cứ khi nào cô muốn không. Geommugeuk trả lời rằng hiện tại anh không thể mở nó ra.

Sau khi Joo Hyang-wol rời đi, Geom Woo-jin lo lắng rằng Joo gia kiếm gia (Ju clan swordsman) không thể đối phó với Hoàng Đạo Thương Đoàn (Hwangdo Sangdan), ám chỉ mối liên hệ giữa Hoàng Đạo (Zodiac) và sự việc này. Geommugeuk cho rằng đây là cơ hội để họ thay đổi. Anh nói đùa rằng phải giúp cô gái thích cha mình hơn anh. Geom Woo-jin hỏi kế hoạch tiếp theo là gì. Geommugeuk dự đoán rằng Hoàng Đạo Thương Đoàn (Hwangdo Sangdan) sẽ cố gắng đánh cắp thỏa thuận hoặc tìm hiểu danh tính của họ. Anh quyết định tung tin giả về danh tính của họ. Anh muốn họ viết một thỏa thuận khác, có lợi cho bên mạnh hơn, và sẽ sử dụng danh nghĩa của Cái Bang Thiếu Lâm (Gansu Seodo faction) để ký kết.

Hwi nhận ra Geom Woo-jin đang thay đổi và đánh giá cao con trai mình. Anh nhận ra rằng Geom Woo-jin tỏa sáng hơn trong quá trình hành động hơn là chỉ nhìn vào kết quả. Anh cảm thấy những lời đề nghị năm năm của Geommugeuk có thể không còn quá xa vời.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-452/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-454/)453  

This is the safest place in the martial arts world?




Joo Hyang-wol did not take those words as boasting or bluff, but accepted them this way.


‘This person trusts his father so much.’


She knows what that feels like. She’s been through it herself. Her father’s embrace was the safest place for her.


As if in a flash, memories of my father flashed before my eyes.


The way he taught himself martial arts when he was young.


The sight of him leading the swordsmen with dignity and poise.


The back of him standing alone in the yard, looking up at the moon.


Even the image of him being sick before he passed away.


In those many scenes, he never took the initiative. He never took the initiative to ask his father to have a meal with him, and he never took the initiative to ask his father to go on a trip with him like these people.


When I was young, there were so many things I wanted to do with my father, but as I grew up, there were fewer and fewer things I wanted to do. Even if there were things I wanted to do, I probably put them off until later. I thought my father would always be by my side.




‘Father, I miss you.’


Her gaze turned to the person who had made her miss her father so much today. The person who had silently reached out and held the agreement.


When I first saw him in front of the guest house, an indescribable emotion suddenly surged up and then disappeared. The feeling I felt for the first time. Was this meant to be the case?


Then she realized that she had not properly thanked him. She quickly got up from her seat and thanked him politely.


“Thank you very much for taking charge of the agreement.”


Geum Woo-jin raised his head and looked at her.


“It’s okay.”


It was just a short statement, but it sounded incredibly reassuring and gentle.


Geommugeuk felt that the way she looked at her father was different.


If you just let this go, it’s not a sword play.




-What if I’m more popular with the girls than my son?


At the sound of the sword dance, a sneer appeared on Geom Woo-jin’s lips. Surprisingly, the sneer did not deny his son’s words.


Your father is a man too, right?


As he was looking at me with these eyes, Joo Hyang-wol, who was next to him, spoke to Geommu-geuk.


“I think Mr. Sohyeop likes my father a lot.”


“Can you feel it?”


As she nodded, Geommugeuk raised his voice towards his father.


“Have you heard? The whole world knows how much I love you, Father.”


Of course, this sad echo was not conveyed to the father. Geum Woo-jin spoke to Hwi as if he was not interested.


“Hey, give me some tea.”




Whiga picked up the teapot and politely poured it into Geom Woojin’s glass.


Although they were in the same place, the two seemed to be in different worlds.


‘You pretend not to see it, you pretend not to care, and yet you read the entire text of the agreement!’


That’s why every moment of this trip with my father is enjoyable.


“It’s okay since you at least recognize me.”


“Come to think of it, I don’t even know your name.”


“It’s sword smoke.”


I used a pseudonym that I always use, and I also added the words that I say whenever I say it.


“It’s not fate, it’s fate. We’ll meet like this and then disappear like smoke.”


Geommugeuk introduced his father and Hui.


“As you may know, that cruel man is my father, and that man is my uncle.”


I could feel Hwi flinching at the introduction of his uncle.


Of course, he expected to be introduced as a family member or a bodyguard, but how flustered must he have been when he was introduced as his father’s brother?


He was embarrassed, but his father looked at him with a satisfied expression.


Mr. Whee, you can be my uncle. You are more than qualified to be one.


“If there was a silence contest, these two would be the winner and runner-up.”


Juhyangwol smiled in sympathy at Geommu-geuk’s words. The two of them were truly taciturn.


In particular, the man, the uncle, did not say a word. But I felt one thing. He saw everything, heard everything.


“Of course, I will do both of your talking for you.”


Joo Hyang-wol laughed. She really did talk a lot. But then she became serious. It was not the time to sit and laugh, but she was laughing thoughtlessly again.




In the meantime, the new dish we ordered came out.


The new dish was placed in front of Juhyangwol, and Geommu-geuk ate the leftover food that he had not been able to eat because he was talking earlier. Father and Hui also took some food and left it aside for him.


Even though time had passed while we were talking, the food stayed warm and didn’t get cold.


The sword dance could tell that his father had warmed up the leftover food in the hot pot.


‘No one will believe it, but I look like my father.’


During this trip, Geommugeuk gradually saw a new side of his father.


Joo Hyang-wol ate her food in silence. There was a strange comfort in this place, but her heart was worried.


How could Geommugeuk not read such a mind?


“Are you worried?”


“To be honest, I don’t know what to do next.”


This was also a remark that would bring shame to the reputation of the Joo clan. I had to go back and share these concerns with my mother and the family’s masters.


But I can already picture what the situation will be like when I get back.


My mother would hate that the meeting broke down, but if I told her that I had entrusted that important agreement to someone I had never met before, she would have been furious. I could picture my mother getting angry and yelling.


But my mother wouldn’t know. From the beginning, I assumed that the alliance with the Hwangdo Sangdan was a wrong choice because I didn’t trust my mother.


The distrust that comes from the way you frequently pour out your emotions to your children without filtering them.

This time, the distrust was correct. Mother had misunderstood the other person. Furthermore, she could not know exactly what their intentions were, but the situation was more serious than ever.


Because I felt that, I didn’t want to leave this place. The moment I got up here, that serious situation would become my reality.


I wanted to rely on these people. Even though I knew I shouldn’t, I kept wanting to run away.


“Go back and prepare.”


Joo Hyang-wol, who had been silently looking down at the food, raised her head and looked at Geommu-geuk.


“The enemy has bared his teeth and is ready to devour you. Then you must prepare to fight.”


I should have been encouraged by the words of the sword dance, but instead, I was only worried.


“My mother won’t believe me.”


From that one word, I could guess what kind of relationship she and her mother had.


Geommugeuk, who had been staring at her for a while, said something unexpected.


“Parents don’t usually believe what their children say. Do you know why?”


“Why?”


“Because they lived through those times. We talked nonsense, we complained, we lied, we rebelled. Aren’t they the ones who watched us grow up? How can we believe that guy who says he’s grown up now? Even if you say you’ve mastered the best lightness in the world, wouldn’t your child tell you to be careful of carriages when crossing the street? They remember us running forward without looking left or right.”


Joo Hyang-wol said with a faint smile.


“You speak as if you have raised three children.”


“Parents and children are a two-way relationship. We keep forgetting that.”


Why was it? The moment she heard those words, Joo Hyang-wol thought of her mother.


Geommugeuk looked at his father.


“My father doesn’t believe me either.”


This was something I said a while ago when I was practicing the Nine-Handed Demonic Cultivation, about stepping far away from a dangerous situation.




Then, Geum Woo-jin blurted out to Joo Hyang-wol without thinking.


“Young lady, don’t trust that guy either.”


At those words, Joo Hyang-wol smiled without realizing it.


“You are going too far!”


Contrary to what he said, the gaze of Geommugeuk looking at his father was gentle.


You can believe slowly. You can believe later, very later, after this journey is over. After five years, you can say, “I believe in you.”


The swordsman spoke to her again.


“So go back and talk to your mother.”


“I don’t have the confidence to convince my mother.”


“The merchant who left earlier will also go back and persuade someone.”


“What does that mean?”


“Since we failed to reach an agreement today, I will explain this to someone and convince them. Ask them to give me the job again. I promise I will succeed next time. Even those who are in a better position than you are making such efforts, so why are you giving up already?”


“!”


It was an unexpected rebuke.


“I just thought about it based on my gut feeling. Don’t do that.”


Geommu-geuk got up from his seat, went to where Hwang-in and her were sitting, and took the brush she was about to sign with.


“Write it down. What should I say and how should I say it? What should I say as my first words? If my mother comes out like this, I should do this. Write it all down.”


Joo Hyang-wol looked at Geommu-geuk with a surprised expression. At first, she thought it was a joke, but it turned out that he was serious.


“What if it still doesn’t work?”


“Write that down too. What should I do then?”




“!”


“Nothing is as difficult as persuading people, even though it looks easy. Of all of them, persuading family is the hardest. It’s actually hard because we know each other too well. So don’t try to persuade them, but do it with the mindset of having a conversation that’s been piling up. Have you ever asked your mother what’s been bothering her these days? Do you know if she’s eating properly?”


Joo Hyang-wol couldn’t say anything.


Because from some point on, I only focused on my mother’s mistakes and only missed my father.


Joo Hyang-wol got up from her seat. The words that Hwang In-do must be persuading someone, and that she should have a conversation instead of persuading her mother, made her jump up.


Yeah, this is not the time to run away. I won’t be that weak.


“Thanks for the advice.”


She looked at Geumwoojin. Her father’s image overlapped his face again. “Father, I’ll do my best.”


“Thank you so much for your work today.”


She was about to turn around and leave, but then she glanced back and said.


“But the safest safe in this martial arts world, can I find it whenever I want?”


The first joke she brought out was accepted with a laugh by Geommugeuk.


“Look at my face and judge for yourself. For now, I can’t open it.”


She looked at Geum Woo-jin quietly as if she was really going to judge it, then bowed politely and left the guest house.


Now only three people remain in the inn.


“I think you’ll do well when you go back since you even have the leeway to joke around.”


Aside from that, there was something else to worry about, Geum Woo-jin.


“The Hwangdo Sangdan are people that the Ju clan swordsman cannot deal with.”


These words made it clear that the Zodiac was somehow connected to what was happening.


“I guess so.”




“Why did you provoke her when you knew?”


“We’ll take the lead and deal with this anyway, but they need to change too. If they don’t, they’ll be eaten by others someday.”


There was a silly joke added to it.


“She is a woman who likes her father more than me, so I have to help her. This time, I realized my father’s popularity. I am definitely my father’s son!”


As before, this joke didn’t work.


Nonsense! I thought he would say that. Instead, my father made an expression that said, “I was popular when I was young.” Anyway, no one can match that haughty and show-off expression.


“What are you going to do now?”


Geum Woo-jin asked his son what he thought first.


“Maybe they’ll come to steal the agreement first?”


It wasn’t a guess because it was connected to the background.


It’s because of what Hwang In said earlier.


– I am a person who is certain about give and take.


Although he disguises himself as a merchant, he cannot stand being in debt.


“He who looks cautious will try to find out our true identity first.”


Predictions came out smoothly from my numerous experiences in the field of sword dance.


“Since he emphasized that he is just a merchant, he probably won’t come forward himself. Then he will probably leave it to the information merchant to figure out our identity.”


One thing that must never be allowed is for the identity of one’s father or oneself to be revealed.


“We’re trying to get our hands on the information in advance. We’re going to let them know that we’re fake.”


Geum Woo-jin nodded silently. Hwi, who was watching him, could feel that the leader was satisfied with his son’s judgment.


I have been following the leader for a long time, but I have never seen him express his emotions as much as he has lately.




Hwi understood this change in the leader.


Since I was always by his side, I heard all kinds of information about the Sword Dance Theater. Where and who was being eliminated, and where and who was being eliminated.


However, hearing about the sword dance and experiencing it firsthand were completely different.


I definitely felt this during this trip. The leader is someone who shines more through the process than the results.


If you only heard the results of this incident from Cheonmajeon, you would only know that the Sogyoju helped the Jushigeomga from the male and female of the Hwangdosangdan.


If that were the case, these things would be omitted.


The fishing bet he made on his way here, the walk with the cult leader and his martial arts training, the advice he gave to Ju Hyang-wol, and even the way he tried to find his place as a bodyguard.


All that emotional exchange would have been omitted and I would not have known. If I had not experienced it alongside them, I would never have known how brilliant it was.


The leader is currently experiencing such a son. The five years that the sub-leader requested are passing by even at this moment.


Before this trip, Hwi thought it was too much of a challenge to the cult leader. He thought the leader would never change his mind.


But as I go on this trip, I feel like I’m starting to think, little by little, that maybe that’s not the case.


“We will disguise ourselves as the Gansu Seodo faction.”


Whenever they used the name Geomyeon, they were always disguised as that sect. Since it was actually a sect run by the Cheonmasingyo, the more I investigated, the more certain the disguise became.


“It’s a political party.”


As expected, my father had a displeased expression on his face.


“If not for this opportunity, when else would you have the chance to act as the head of a political party?”


Geum Woo-jin asked with a snicker.


“What next?”


He looked curious about what choice his son would make.


“Aren’t there people behind those guys that we need to find?”


As if that were true, Geum Woo-jin waited silently for the next words.


“It is easier to deal with the interest than to turn over the palm of your hand. However, if you deal with it indiscriminately, the forces behind it will hide or prepare for it.”


You have to approach them naturally and dig in. For that, the upper part of the zodiac could actually be an opportunity.


The sword master revealed his plan.


“So I’m going to have them write another agreement, one that’s absolutely advantageous to the stronger side.”


What this meant was that they would bring in the Seodo faction, which was a sect they were trying to disguise themselves as.


“We will sign the agreement exactly as it is written.”
