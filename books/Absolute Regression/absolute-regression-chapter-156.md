# Absolute Regression Chapter 156 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Jin Ha-ryeong mơ thấy mình bị truy đuổi và trèo lên cây trốn. Kẻ truy đuổi không mặt dừng lại ngay dưới gốc cây, ngước lên nhìn cô. Cô hét lên nhưng không thành tiếng. Bất ngờ, một người đàn ông xuất hiện, đá văng kẻ truy đuổi. Cô nhận ra đó là người hầu ở quán trọ mà cô từng gặp, người mà cô đã nhầm là chủ nhân.

Tỉnh giấc, Ha-ryeong nhớ rõ khuôn mặt người hầu. Cô đến quán trọ, thấy người hầu đó đang uống rượu một mình. Cô tự nhủ thật nực cười khi tìm đến đây chỉ vì một giấc mơ. Nhưng khi cô định rời đi, người hầu gọi cô lại: "Cô đến ăn mì à?".

Cô ngồi xuống đối diện anh ta, gọi mì và rượu. Anh ta hỏi: "Tôi tưởng cô sẽ không ngồi cùng tôi chứ?". Cô đáp trả: "Đúng vậy". Cô giải thích lý do không phải vì anh ta là người hầu, mà vì cô không muốn người khác khó chịu. Anh ta tự tin nói sẽ không thấy bất tiện. Cô thầm nghĩ, sao một người hầu lại có thể tự tin trước mặt cháu gái của võ lâm minh chủ như vậy.

Cô nhận thấy mình không hòa đồng với ai cả, và việc cô đến đây thật kỳ lạ. Có lẽ tiềm thức của cô cảm nhận được điều gì đó đặc biệt ở người này. Anh ta thoải mái trò chuyện, khoe rằng sư phụ của anh ta cũng đã vào vòng chung kết (finals). Anh ta còn dặn dò cô nương tay với sư phụ của anh ta, vì đã có người chết trong giải đấu này. Cô cho rằng lời anh ta nói thật ngớ ngẩn.

Cô để ý đến thanh kiếm được bọc vải bố của anh ta và hỏi lý do. Anh ta đáp: "Để cho ngầu". Anh ta còn mời cô đi ngắm cảnh Đông Hồ (East Lake). Cô thầm nghĩ anh ta thật điên rồ. Cô hỏi tên anh ta, và anh ta trả lời: "Cứ gọi tôi là 'Shi-jong-ah' (Thị Chung)". Cô cảm thấy anh ta thật quá trớn. Anh ta giải thích tên mình chỉ là "kiếm yên" (sword smoke - khói kiếm), sẽ biến mất như khói.

Song Tae-gun (Tống Thái Quân), bạn thân của Ha-ryeong, xuất hiện. Anh ta biết cô thích mì ở đây. Tae-gun nhìn người đàn ông kia và hỏi. Anh ta chào hỏi và giới thiệu mình là đệ tử của Tào Đạo Phái (Gansu Seodo School) và sư huynh của Seo-ryong (Từ Long). Tae-gun tỏ vẻ ngưỡng mộ.

Khi Tae-gun rời đi, Ha-ryeong tức giận hỏi tại sao anh ta lại nói dối về thân phận đạo sĩ. Cô cho rằng anh ta sợ cô xấu hổ khi đi cùng một người hầu. Anh ta giải thích rằng mình vừa là người hầu, vừa là đệ tử học võ. Cô bỏ đi.

Đêm đó, cô lại mơ thấy mình treo mình trên vách đá và người hầu xuất hiện, đưa tay ra cứu cô. Tỉnh giấc, cô nhớ rõ cảm giác nắm tay anh ta, như một giấc mơ báo trước (precognitive dream). Cô tự nhủ mình thật điên rồ khi cứ mơ những giấc mơ như vậy.

Trong khi đó, Seo Dae-ryong (Từ Đại Long) chuẩn bị cho trận đấu chính thức với người thừa kế của Trương Bình kiếm pháp thế gia (Zhang Ping swordsmanship family). Anh ta được sư huynh mời đến một nơi luyện tập đặc biệt. Sư huynh nói rằng anh ta thua kém đối thủ về mặt khách quan, và bắt đầu mô phỏng kiếm pháp của Trương Bình (Jangpyeonggeomga) để giúp anh ta luyện tập.

Dae-ryong thua liên tục, nhưng không bỏ cuộc. Sư huynh không cho anh ta giải pháp, mà muốn anh ta tự tìm ra câu trả lời. Họ luyện tập suốt đêm. Sáng hôm sau, Dae-ryong nói rằng mình đã mơ thấy mình thua trận. Sư huynh cười và nói: "Vậy thì chúng ta hãy đi xem giấc mơ đó là thật hay là một giấc mơ báo trước nhé?".

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-155/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-157/)The 156th Dream Journal, Precognitive Dream Journal.




Jin Ha-ryeong was being chased by someone.


Unable to shake off her pursuer, she eventually climbed up a tree. She hid herself among the branches and made no sound.


The pursuer, who had been chasing him, ran past a tree and suddenly stopped.


As if a predator had smelled something, the pursuer slowly turned around, then raised his head and looked up at the tree. The man’s face was blank, like a monster’s.


“Aww!” I screamed, but no sound came out of my mouth. She flew away again.


As the distance between them was getting closer, someone ran up from in front and kicked the man following them in the face without mercy.


With a thud, the faceless pursuer rolled away and disappeared.


The man who helped her had flowing hair and a full beard on his face. Where have I seen this man?


The next moment, she screamed.


“Are you that servant?”




The moment he realized that it was the man he had met at the inn, Jin Ha-ryeong opened his eyes wide and woke up from his dream. He actually said his last words as he woke up.


She didn’t usually have dreams, but this was the first time she had such a strange dream.


She was drenched in sweat, as if she had been chased all night.


Even if the dream of being chased is like that, why did that man come out and save her? Was it because she remembered that day when she mistook the servant for the master?


She recalled the face of the hairy servant. It was a face she had seen once, but she remembered it clearly. It was the face she had seen in her dream. Since she was not good at remembering people’s faces, it was a refreshing experience to recall his face so vividly.


“Are you okay?”


The voice of the escort drone, Chuho, was heard outside.


“It’s okay. I just had a nightmare.”


“You must be on edge because of the Little Dragon Chronicles.”


“I guess so.”




“Don’t worry too much. No one can beat you, young lady.”


“I’m going to rest more, so don’t bother me today.”


“yes.”


But after a while, she secretly left her residence and entered the guest house where she had eaten noodles.


When she entered the guest house, the inside was packed with guests. Because of this competition, wherever she went, it was crowded with people.


She saw a man drinking in the corner. It was the servant from her dream. She had come here thinking he might be here, and he really was.


I didn’t come here today because of the noodles. I wanted to meet that servant. I wanted to see if he was really the kind of person who would appear in dreams.


But soon she shook her head and laughed.


How ridiculous it was that she came to see the servant of a remote sect just because he appeared in her dream. As she turned around to leave, someone called her from behind.


“Have you come to eat noodles?”




When he looked back, the attendant had gotten up and was looking at him.


Because of that, the eyes of the people around her were focused on her. Some people who recognized her were surprised. Thinking that if she turned around and left like that, people would look at her strangely, she calmly walked to the servant’s seat and sat down across from him.


After she sat down in front of the servant, she ordered noodles and alcohol.


“I thought you wouldn’t join me.”


“Why?”


“Because last time I found out that I was a servant.”


“You are a noble person, so you won’t be humble with your servants? Is that what you are saying?”


“Isn’t it?”


The corners of Jin Ha-ryeong’s mouth slightly went up at the sight of her asking openly whether it was true or not.


“that’s right.”


She added, finding the man’s expression annoying as if he knew it.


“But the reason is not because the other person is a servant, but because the other person is uncomfortable. He couldn’t eat well because I was in front of him.”


“Oh, then that’s great. I won’t be uncomfortable at all.”


How can a servant be so confident in front of the granddaughter of the martial arts leader?


‘You should know who I am by now.’


It was a type I had never experienced before. I really don’t know, I really don’t know. Even the successors of prestigious political families act really cautiously in front of her. They can’t even think about asking such a sensitive question.


“You always go alone.”


In fact, she didn’t get along well with people, regardless of whether they were servants or not.


I’m the type of person who likes to be alone, so I didn’t even like talking to someone like this. So it’s strange that I ended up here.


I came to think that maybe there was something special about this man that his subconscious sensed, and that’s why he had that dream.




She glanced at the man. His hair was unkempt, his beard was unkempt, and there wasn’t really much to see.


‘It’s a dog dream, a dog dream.’


The man treated her comfortably, whether he knew her feelings or not.


“Oh, our master has also advanced to the finals.”


She also heard rumors about him. She heard from her escort, Chuho, that he had advanced to the main tournament by causing a change. It must have been a sect where people in the countryside, ignorant of the ways of the world, only practiced martial arts. That’s why he could have advanced to the main tournament. Just by looking at this naive and naive man, you can guess the atmosphere of the sect.


“The young master may end up fighting with the young lady. Oh, did you know that? There were people who died in the main event. Please take good care of our young master!”


“It would be an honorable death for an unmanned person to die on stage.”


“Isn’t this an unjust death rather than an honorable death?”


“What do you mean?”


“There’s no place safer than the stage for a human being. There are set rules, judges, and people watching, so you can’t make an ambush. But dying on this stage? Isn’t that such an unfair death?”


She thought it was some kind of sophistry, but she couldn’t think of anything to refute it, because she had never thought of it that way before.


“You speak as if you were an unmanned vehicle.”


“I also learned swordsmanship.”


“You have found a good master. He even teaches swordsmanship to his servants.”


“Yes, I learned from a really scary person. Probably the scariest person in the world.”

Jin Ha-ryeong snorted inwardly. How many people have he met to say something like that? Has he ever met a truly scary person? Well, in the village he came from, his master might have been the scariest.


Her gaze turned to the sword on the attendant’s waist.


“Why is the scabbard wrapped in cloth?”


It was wrapped tightly in a commonly available burlap. There were two common cases: when a ronin traveling in a dangerous place would wrap the scabbard to prevent it from being damaged, or when a valuable sword was to be hidden.


“I did it to look cool.”


“Then shouldn’t it be wrapped in nice silk?”


“It’s cool because it’s not silk. The key is that it looks like it was done without being done.”


Seeing her bewildered, the man went even further.


“I heard that the East Lake here is so beautiful. Could you please show me around next time?”


You can’t say that to yourself unless you’re crazy. It’s time for a mere servant to yell at someone for saying something like that.


Why are you just here?


You said you had a dream? No. It must be because you don’t want to be a s!ut who treats people of lower status rudely. My grandfather hated it when his children and grandchildren were the subject of such gossip. Yes, that must be why.


“Then I will definitely show you other beautiful sights I know.”


Does this person believe that such a moment will come for him? He seems ready to go on a cruise together, even though they’ve only been together twice.


She sighed involuntarily. It was her fault for coming here.


“What is your name?”


He asks with anger. Hey kid, what’s your name? It’s a question with emotion.


“Just call me ‘Shi-jong-ah’.”


This guy really goes all the way!


“Doesn’t that make me look so spoiled?”




“It’s sword smoke. It’s not fate, it’s smoke. I’ll stay like this and then disappear like smoke.”


The man smiled brightly. Jin Ha-ryeong always seemed to be quite the oddball.


Then someone came and called her name.


“Command.”


He was Song Tae-gun (宋泰君), the son of the leader of the Blue Dragon Group, and he was her only friend who had grown up with her since childhood. The moment she saw him, Jin Ha-ryeong was inwardly embarrassed.


“You came to eat noodles.”


Song Tae-gun knew very well that she liked the noodles here.


“How did you know I was here?”


“As I was passing by here, the customers who came out of here were talking about you. You ran away again to avoid the man in the woods.”


Song Tae-gun looked at the man with her and asked.


“But who are you?”


Jin Ha-ryeong was embarrassed, not knowing what to say.


Then the man greeted him and offered him a lottery ticket.


“It’s called the Sword of the Gansu Seodo School. My brother-in-law has advanced to the main competition this time.”


“Ah! If you’re a Seodopa, then isn’t your death row inquisitor’s name Seo-ryong?”


“you’re right.”


“I heard that you are causing a stir in this competition. It is an honor to meet a disciple of such a great sect.”


“My death penalty is great. I just cheer from outside the stage.”


“Your swordsmanship seems much more impressive than the death penalty.”


“What are you talking about?”




“Don’t you know how hard it is to sit here with this guy? Even though he’s my old friend, it’s hard for me.”


Then Jin Ha-ryeong said to him.


“Stop talking nonsense and go. See you later.”


It seemed like he wanted to stay longer, but Song Tae-gun said goodbye with a smile as Jin Ha-ryeong gave off a cold aura.


“Let’s have a drink next time.”


“Yes, that’s right.”


As Song Tae-gun left, Jin Ha-ryeong coldly questioned him.


“Why did you lie and say you were a priest? Why? Did you think that if they found out I was there with you as a servant, you would be embarrassed?”


To be honest, she had that kind of feeling. When she was asked who Song Tae-gun was, she was momentarily flustered. She hesitated to introduce him as a servant. It hit the nail on the head and she felt ashamed.


“Strictly speaking, it’s not a lie. I am a servant, but I learned martial arts from a certain school, so I am also a disciple.”


“Once is enough for sophistry.”


Jin Ha-ryeong kicked the seat and left the place.


And that night, she had another nightmare.


This time, I had a dream where I was hanging off a cliff and the servant appeared again and reached out to save me.


Jin Ha-ryeong, who woke up at dawn, looked down at his hands. He vividly remembered the feeling of holding hands with Geomyeon. It was as vivid as a precognitive dream.


“You crazy bitch, why do you keep doing this?”


She knew the answer too. Why is that? Because she’s doing something she’s never done before.


She covered herself with the blanket again and lay down, but sleep did not come easily.


\* \* \*


Seo Dae-ryong’s first opponent in the main tournament was the successor of the famous Zhang Ping swordsmanship family in Fujian.




“Would you like to practice with me?”


“With your lord?”


When I first suggested that we practice, Seo Dae-ryong was surprised.


“I am honored.”


“Follow me.”


I took Seodaeryong to the mountains where I was training.


“Even when I look for a place to practice, it’s definitely different from mine. How did you find all these places?”


The wide space was blocked on all sides and there was only one entrance. Since you only had to focus on one place, it was the perfect place to practice martial arts.


“Come here and practice from now on.”


“No. You should practice more than I do. The quality of practice is as different as heaven and earth.”


“Is that really so?”


“yes?”


“Don’t you think that your training, in which you risk your life and your life to challenge the martial arts competition, is a much more valuable training? If you are the sky and I am the earth, then I will admit it.”


“Thank you for saying that, but that doesn’t mean the world will change. And even if it did, it wouldn’t feel so good.”


Yes, the right arm is someone like this. It’s not a matter of whether martial arts are stronger or weaker. The right arm should be someone who makes you feel good even when exchanging words, and who can tell you exactly what’s on their mind. At least the right arm.


“Have you seen the successor of the Jangpyeong Sword Family fighting?”


“Yes. You really fight well, don’t you?”


“In objective terms, you are inferior.”


“Seeing you say that, I can definitely say it.”


I nodded honestly. I couldn’t overcome the gap in the period of time I had spent properly training in martial arts. In addition, I hadn’t completely learned the martial arts of the Blood Heavenly Demon, and I couldn’t freely display my demonic energy. Either way, it was a difficult fight.




“Okay, I will imitate the martial arts of Jangpyeonggeomga and perform them, so think of me as your opponent!”


“yes!”


I imitated the swordsmanship of the successor of Jangpyeong Swordsmanship and fought Seodaeryong as if he were fighting.


Seo Dae-ryong lost and lost again. I didn’t let him off, and after each game, Seo Dae-ryong’s body was covered in bruises. There were times when his life was in danger, but he didn’t give up.


“Please do it one more time.”


Seo Dae-ryong tried every method he could. He tried this and that. He tried everything.


I silently repeated the same thing over and over again, waiting for him to figure out the answer on his own. I didn’t give him a winning solution.


Even if I lose in battle, I have to find it myself. The mission is important, but this moment, which is a turning point in the life of ‘Unmanned Seodaeryong’, is more important.


We practiced martial arts all night long. Seo Dae-ryong was exhausted, but his eyes had a look in them that he had never shown before.


And four hours before the main event.


Seo Dae-ryong, who said he would train until the end, was forced to sleep.


Seo Dae-ryong, who said he couldn’t sleep because he was so nervous, started snoring as soon as he lay down.


I woke up Seodaeryong after leaving the rain for half an hour.


“Are you feeling refreshed?”


“Yes. I think I can survive. But what should I do?”


“why?”


“I had a dream that I lost in a fight.”


He said this with a smile while looking at the sad-looking Seo Dae-ryong.


“Well, shall we go and check if that dream is a dream or a precognitive dream?”
