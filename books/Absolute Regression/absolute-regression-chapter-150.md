Yang Cheo-gi cố gắng thuyết phục Gi Bang-in rằng mình không phản bội và việc Thiên Mệnh Hội Chủ có liên quan khiến tình hình phức tạp hơn. Gi Bang-in ra lệnh điều tra vụ việc và treo thưởng cho cái đầu của bất kỳ kẻ xâm nhập nào.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-149/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-151/)Episode 150: Good people must die.




The evil song master Gi Bang-in was so angry that he couldn’t hold it in anymore.


“Are you telling me to believe that now?”


“What’s the big deal about believing it or not? It’s just something that happened.”


“It doesn’t just happen that two great masters of evil songs die at the same time.”


The short-statured gisaeng with gloomy eyes originally had a way of calming people down. When his mood changed, the air around him became so stuffy that it was hard to breathe.


“Can you defeat the monster? Are you confident that you can defeat the Iron Chain? I’m not confident. And neither are you. How can I believe that those two were killed by the evil Soma? And in the same place! Together!”


“It wasn’t because of the evil Soma. It was because of the Demonic Cult’s Duke.”


“That’s what you’re talking about!”


It was natural for the voice to be raised. The evil song master did not know about Geommugeuk’s skills. In the martial arts world, only those who handled very confidential information knew that Geommugeuk’s skills were greater than expected, but Geommugeuk’s skills were not yet known to the world.


“Wasn’t it just them? Didn’t you send the Paradise Fairy, the Bloody Three Army, the Bloody Rangdo, and the King of Hell with you? And yet you annihilated them all and came back alive alone!”




“I barely made it out alive! I almost died.”


“You know what? Your words are so ridiculous that they almost sound like the truth. Surely you wouldn’t be so stupid as to make such ridiculous excuses.”


The evil song master couldn’t believe this situation. In this incident, he lost two of his strongest men. He sent them all away so that no one would die.


“What were the two great heroes doing when they died?”


“When I was about to step forward, the Bloody Heavenly Sword appeared. That old man’s internal energy was so profound that I couldn’t do anything.”


Yang Cheo-gi thoroughly hid the fact that he had come forward after the death of Goe-ma and Cheol-sae-ja. Gok-ju would suspect him and investigate him here and there, but he would have no choice but to believe his own words. It was a clear fact that there were only Geommu-geuk, Geuk-ak-soma, and Hyeon-cheon-doma there that day.


“I also have a relationship with Cheonmyeonghoeju, so why would I ruin things? Please believe me.”


The evil song master regretted it. If he had known that things would turn out this way, he would never have joined hands with Cheonmyeonghoeju. It occurred to him later that the sweet thing he offered might be poison. Greed is always the cause of trouble.


What’s past is past. The problem now is this: With their deaths, his position as a baron is in jeopardy.


Among all the organizations in the martial arts world, the one whose leader changes the fastest is this Akingok. This is because it is full of people who immediately show their teeth when they see the leader showing weakness.




‘If you were trying to take my place, you won’t die a pretty death.’


Even if he originally harbored such feelings, the gisaeng man did not show it on the outside. He was the type of person who always smiled at the enemies he had to kill.


But today, I couldn’t hold back my anger.


“I don’t want to see your face, so please go away. We’ll talk again later.”


“Let’s do that.”


As the shepherd was about to turn around, the evil song master spoke.


“Do you know what my nickname was before I came here?”


“What was it?”


“It was the worst. It was the worst because it possessed all the evils of the world.”


“Was it so?”




The indifferent response made the evil song master even angrier. Whether he knew her feelings or not, Yang Cheo-gi gave her a new worry.


“They’ll guess I’m here.”


“What are you trying to say? So they might invade the song you saw, is that what you’re trying to say?”


“That’s not impossible.”


This was a way to block the possibility that the evil songwriter might try to kill him.


“You cut off both our arms, so we will have to fight with our feet. If what you say is true, we are all dead now.”


Of course, I didn’t mean it sincerely. If the evil song had collapsed without them, the evil song would have disappeared in the first place. After all, this was a place teeming with countless evil people who had been driven to the brink of ruin.


No one in the world would dare to dip into this dirty water, as they have done so far.


As soon as the shepherd left, the evil song master called his subordinate and gave an order.


“Investigate this matter thoroughly, and kill anyone who enters the cave from this time on. Inform everyone! Each intruder’s head will be rewarded with fifty thousand nyang.”


\* \* \*


We sent a letter to our school requesting the introduction of the horse and sword and headed straight to Akingok.


We ran on horseback because it was faster than riding a horse.


A journey running with the Bloodthirsty Demon and the Evil Soma? It was something I could never have imagined before or even after returning.


I’ve traveled with the evil Soma before, but this was my first time with the Bloodthirsty Doma. I learned something new about him during this trip.


Hyeolcheondoma, who seemed like someone who would just stay in his room and read books, had surprisingly been to almost every place in the Central Plains. Whenever he came across a place he knew, Hyeolcheondoma would stop running and tell him about it.


“If you go over that mountain, you will come across a place called Joya Plain. There, I fought the vagrant who challenged me with a five-legged fight. It happened when I was young.”


Like this, a story about a fight you had.


“There’s a sect in that village that’s made up entirely of women. The sect leader and her disciple both liked me.”


I was naturally telling such ridiculous and false stories. At that time, the evil Soma and I simultaneously sent messages to each other. That was a lie.




“The area beyond that side is under the influence of the Apostolic Alliance. If you go eight hundred li in that direction, you will reach the territory of the Murim Alliance.”


He was also knowledgeable about the terrain and the martial arts world.


There were many times when I wanted to clap my hands when I saw things that overlapped with what I knew, but I had to hold back.


“But, was your internal energy this deep?”


Hyeolcheondoma looked puzzled as he saw me running alongside them without falling behind at all.


“I took an elixir that a very noble person gave me as a gift.”


That elixir was the Heavenly Goddess that Blood Heavenly Demon had given him a long time ago.


“That alone isn’t enough to demonstrate this level of internal energy?”


“This time, while dealing with the Paradise Fairy, I absorbed her internal energy.”


Of course, there were other coincidences as well, but I won’t mention them all.


“Ah, heaven really is helping you.”


“So, both of you, please help me out.”


Then, the Bloodthirsty Demon and the Evil Demon suddenly started running towards me.


They hate each other but they get along so well just to tease each other. Maybe the two of them don’t hate each other that much.


I ran after them and shouted.

“Where are those who are slower than me running away from?”


\* \* \*


So we ran and ran until we arrived at the entrance to the evil song.


I could see Ilhwageomjon and Chwima waiting in the distance. They were drunk and swimming, and I had only seen them tending to flowers in the garden, so it felt different when I saw them from outside.


The sight of Chwima looking up at the sky with his arms folded looked somehow lonely and cool, and the sight of Geomjon standing with his sword in his clean white robe looked dignified and elegant. Both of them felt different.


“older brother!”


When I called him “hyung” even in the presence of the demons, Chuma’s expression brightened.


“Our little brother!”


I focused on my relationship with Chuma without being conscious of my other relationships.


“Thank you for coming, brother.”


It is rude to both the master and the other demons to be overly cautious or concerned about their relationships with other demons.


I am a person who is good at drinking and being friendly. I believe that when I can clearly express who I am, I can form good relationships with other people.


“I usually don’t disturb my closing ceremony unless something serious happens, but Yeobin sent me word that my younger brother needs my help. How on earth did you get Yeobin on my younger brother’s side?”


All I did was take care of my brother’s health. So Yeobin is the one who is truly on my brother’s side.


I couldn’t answer like that, so I answered with a smile.


“After this work is over, I’ll buy you a drink.”


I immediately greeted Ilhwageomjon politely.


“Your beauty shines even brighter when you see it from outside.”


“I feel this way every time, but the gold lacquer you give me feels the best. I heard you fought those evil bastards this time. Are you hurt anywhere?”


“Yes. Because Thomas appeared at a crucial moment.”




Ilhwageomjon looked at Hyeolcheondoma and said.


“I might have waited. For the decisive moment.”


At those words, Hyeolcheon Doma said with a dumbfounded expression.


“That’s right. I’ve been hiding and waiting. When will the decisive moment come? I should show up when the crisis is a little more serious.”


“Still, I’m glad you arrived on time. You did a good job.”


For some reason, Ilhwageomjon ended the conversation with good words. Hyeolcheondoma gave me a look that said, “Why is that woman suddenly acting like that?” But how could I know what she was thinking?


Perhaps, when we came together, Chwima said something nice about Hyeolcheondoma? If so, today might be the day that reconciliation begins.


Ilhwageomjon asked me again.


“So? The mastermind hid in here?”


“Yes. I checked once more through Tongcheon-gak and confirmed that it went into the Ak-ingok section.”


“This place is quite annoying.”


“Fortunately, Soma-nim knows a lot about evil songs.”


“okay?”


Ilhwageomjon’s gaze turned to the evil Soma. His blood-stained mask told him how urgent the situation was.


The evil soma bowed his head slightly, and Ilhwageomjon also greeted the evil soma. The evil soma and Ilhwageomjon were friends, but they were respectful to each other.


It seemed like they were just watching each other, but in fact, it was because of Ilhwageomjon that they developed a relationship with Geukaksoma. When Cheongseon was established as the Subhonmajon, she told me that Geukaksoma had voted in favor. That was why she went to see Geukaksoma.


“Our target is the sheep herders. The evildoers here are those who have committed crimes that deserve to die, but there is no need to commit unnecessary massacres. I think it would be enough to just eliminate those who stand in your way.”


He nodded with an expression that said he understood everything I said.


“There’s another thing I want to say about Yang Cheo-gi. Although the goal is to capture him alive, he is so skilled in martial arts that if capturing him alive is not possible, we can kill him. If possible, we should capture him alive. I’m not saying that we should take risks and capture him alive. The safety of everyone here comes first.”


Then Chwima said to Ilhwageomjon.




“Which one of us is our brother so worried about?”


“Are you a drunk brother?”


“Oh, me?”


Even though they are the devils, going into the evil song might be burdensome and unpleasant. But they didn’t show it at all. They didn’t even joke around. I think that was their intention for me. It’s a gratitude that I should never forget.


“Thank you for coming here for me. It is truly an honor to be able to carry out a mission with the four demons. I will not forget today. If there is a painter, please draw a picture of us today… … Oh, where are you going? Listen to everything before you go! I will go with you!”


I followed the demons who had left first and entered the evil song.


As we walked a little further inside, there was a warning sign written in red letters.


-Good people must die.


Then Chwima looked around at us and said.


“Fortunately, none of us died.”


Everyone laughed together at those words.


“I am dangerous.”


When I expressed my grievance, the evil Soma said:


“If we go by that phrase, the safest person is a person with engineering skills.”


Everyone’s gazes toward me seemed to agree with those words. Only Chwima took my side.


“I believe in my brother’s innocence. My brother is the kindest person in the world.”


“So doesn’t that make him seem more evil?”


Hyeolcheon Doma, who had been listening, couldn’t hold it in any longer and said something.


“That little brother, I hate hearing that little brother.”


I quickly accepted his words, fearing that he might start a war of nerves with me.




“That’s right. Who would live in sorrow without an older or younger sibling?”


Then, Chwima smiled and took a sip of his alcohol. I had been watching him since we first met, and he had definitely been drinking less than before.


He sent a message to the horse.


-You’ve cut down on drinking a lot. That’s great, bro.


-Thank you for understanding.


I couldn’t bring myself to have this conversation in front of the other Amazons.


How long did it take to walk like that?


We met a man carrying a basket of herbs. Just as he was about to pass by, he bowed and said hello to us.


Shhh! Bang!


He fell to the ground with his forehead pierced by a bloodshot wound from the evil soma.


“He’s a scout guarding the entrance. When someone comes in, he goes to the shortcut and informs them. In addition to this person… … .”


Shhh! Slap!


Before I could even mention that they were hiding on trees and behind rocks, Ilhwageomjon hurled his sword energy and Hyeolcheondoma hurled his sword energy.


The man hiding in the tree fell to his death, and the rock was cut in half, and the man behind him suffered the same fate. There was no need to talk when moving with the demons. It was just as easy as it was easy.


“It’s been a long time since I’ve been here, but nothing has changed here. Even back then, the three of us were guarding this place.”


I smiled and answered the evil Soma’s words.


“Isn’t this the same for our school? It doesn’t seem like much has changed from decades ago to now.”


Then Chwima took a sip of his wine and said:


“So, is our brother trying to establish a new magic kingdom?”


Instead of answering, I smiled and looked at the demons. I was becoming closer to them, but I still didn’t know how much they would understand the magic I was pursuing.




Going a little further in, I saw a few houses, and in front of them were rice paddies and fields. They also grew fruit trees and raised cows and pigs. It was no different from any other village.


But there was a terrible trap next to the field, and the flowerbeds with colorful flowers were swarming with poisonous insects.


A poisonous bee flew in from somewhere and attacked us, but it was impossible for the bee to sting the Amazon in the first place. With just one wave of the hand, they were all swept away at once.


If there hadn’t been someone who knew this place as well as the evil Soma, the road to get here would have been much more difficult. Where there seemed to be no path, there was a path, and where there seemed to be a safe path, there were traps.


The evil Soma only guided us through shortcuts to avoid traps.


Finally, I could see the village in the distance. It was the first village I saw after entering Akingok.


“There are some pretty dangerous traps here and there from here to the village entrance tree. Just jump over them.”


My four demons and I flew at the same time.


We flew across a distance that ordinary masters could never cross. It was elegant and splendid, and it was an extreme lightness that no one could imitate.


Chock! Chock! Chock! Chock! Chock!


We got down in line at the same time.


The moment he landed on the ground, swords, swords, wind, and tension flew in all directions. The enemies who were lying in ambush around him fell down without even being able to attack him. Even though he hadn’t decided on who to attack in advance, there were no overlapping attacks. These were the demons of our school.


“Okay, let’s go in.”


On my left stood Hyeolcheon Doma, and on my right stood Ilhwa Geomjon. On either end stood Geukak Soma and Chuima.


With the strongest wings in the world, I walked into the village of the wicked.
