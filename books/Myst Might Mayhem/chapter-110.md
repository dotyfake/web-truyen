 Chapter 110 – The Final Gate (1)


 She couldn’t even perceive it, yet the tip of his finger was touching her.


 “You’re slow.”


 Drip!


 At Mok Gyeong-un’s words, a drop of cold sweat trickled down Mo Ha-rang’s fair cheek.


 It felt like her neck would be pierced with the slightest movement.


 Inwardly, she was perplexed.


 Although she acknowledged that Mok Gyeong-un possessed a strange power that differed from others, she hadn’t considered it as superiority in martial arts.


 But what was this?


 ‘…He has changed.’


 What on earth had happened overnight?


 Even if she excluded judging Mok Gyeong-un’s martial arts through energy perception since it was impossible in the first place, what was going on?


 The sharp energy transmitted from the tip of his blade finger was almost akin to the feeling one would get from masters who had reached the realm of Ascension.


 

 ‘This feeling, it’s similar to Father’s, no…’


 It was similar to what she had felt from the Clan Leader of the Demon Fire Hall.


 The only supreme master of the Transcendent Realm she could contend with, the Clan Leader of the Demon Fire Hall.


 That feeling emanated from Mok Gyeong-un.


 ‘No. It can’t be.’


 Mo Ha-rang instantly denied it.


 No matter how talented one was, reaching the initial-stage Transcendent Realm at a mere seventeen or eighteen years old wasn’t a simple feat.


 Even if he had gained enlightenment, how could he become so strong overnight…


 ‘Ah!’


 Could it be because he ate that?


 The Heavenly Earth Pill.


 It was an elixir made from the secret recipe of the Heaven and Earth Society, and just eating one pill could grant 10 to 15 years’ worth of internal energy.


 The gap between 10 and 15 years was absolutely insurmountable.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c4f98310f240f4d43d687", id: "pf-8947-1"}) ‘…But can such a difference occur just from this?’


 Mo Ha-rang continued to be confused.


 Seeing her like that, Mok Gyeong-un was inwardly satisfied.


 Due to the overlapping fateful encounters in the treasure vault, he had entered the Transcendent Realm, but he still couldn’t accurately judge his level.


 So he had initiated a sparring match with Mo Ha-rang, whom he had previously fought, to confirm how much he had improved.


 ‘Not bad.’


 The gap had definitely widened, as Cheong-ryeong had said.


 The saying that Transcendent Realm supreme masters and Peak Realm masters were incomparable realms now made sense to him.


 Her every movement was too clearly visible, unlike last time.


 “You’re still far, mortal.”


 At that moment, Cheong-ryeong’s voice rang in his ears.


 “You may have shed your novice shell, but even within the Transcendent Realm, the difference between the early, proficient, and pinnacle stages is distinct. You still have a long way to go.”


 ‘…It should be that way.’


 Of course, he had no intention of letting his guard down.


 The target of his revenge might be a peerless master at the peak of the supreme transcendent realm, close to Enlightenment, so his current level was not yet satisfactory.


 However, apart from that, a different emotion arose.


 Mok Gyeong-un had considered martial arts and sword techniques as mere tools for revenge.


 But upon reaching a higher realm, he developed an interest in this thing called martial arts.


 How much stronger could he become through martial arts?


 ‘More… I want to taste more.’


 It was a pure emotion he hadn’t felt in a long time.


 While he was doing so, Mo Ha-rang spoke to Mok Gyeong-un,


 “…Did you perhaps consume the Heavenly Earth Pill?”


 “Ah. That.”


 Mok Gyeong-un took out a small pouch from his bosom and showed it to her.


 The Heavenly Earth Pill was inside it.


 Cheong-ryeong disliked calling it the Heavenly Earth Pill.


 So in front of her, he called it the Moonlight Pill.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c50524a5a770dd7e4e350", id: "pf-8948-1"}) “I haven’t eaten it yet.”


 “Whattt?”


 At Mok Gyeong-un’s words, Mo Ha-rang frowned as if surprised and stared at the pouch.


 She had naturally assumed that Mok Gyeong-un had consumed it.


 But he had become so strong in a short period without even eating it?


 ‘…Is he a monster?’


 She had thought she would never be inferior in martial arts, but for some reason, she felt conflicted.


 Could she really escape from the clutches of this devil?


 \*\*\*


 Around noon the next day.


 In the plaza behind the dormitory of Corpse Blood Valley, several chairs were placed around the stage, and guests from the inner city were arriving one by one.


 Interest flickered in the eyes of Corpse Blood Valley Leader Lee Ji-yeom, who was standing on the stage.


 It was because an unexpected person had appeared.


 ‘The Shadow Clan Master?’


 A middle-aged man with a small stature and a sharp impression.


 He had been puzzled by the unfamiliar face, but upon hearing his identity, he couldn’t help but be surprised.


 That was because the Shadow Clan Master had never participated in the final ceremony before.


 Considering his position and his extremely secretive nature, as well as the peculiar rumors surrounding him, Lee Ji-yeom had been curious about him.


 However,


 ‘…He exceeds expectations.’


 He had tried to gauge his level to some extent through energy perception, but it was difficult to accurately discern.


 That meant the Shadow Clan Master’s martial arts were either almost on par with his own or perhaps even higher.


 If this was true, it was quite unexpected.


 Lee Ji-yeom had gained enlightenment from the secret technique Mok Gyeong-un had given him in the past few days, further advancing his martial arts.


 But if even he couldn’t gauge the Shadow Clan Master’s level…


 Ting!


 At that moment, a sound that pierced the eardrums.


 At this sound, the gazes of those who had arrived earlier turned towards the entrance of the plaza.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) There, a beautiful woman was lying in a seductive pose on a four-person sedan chair.


 At first glance, she appeared to be in her late twenties or early thirties, but the aura she exuded was extraordinary.


 Ting!


 As the string sound rang out once more, an executive sitting on a chair shook his head.


 That executive was none other than the Thunderbolt Fist King Won Byeong-hak, one of the Five Kings.


 ‘It’s starting again.’


 She was a truly unpredictable woman.


 If it weren’t for that self-centered personality of hers, she would have risen to the position of the Fourth Clan Leader, but due to her uncontrollable nature, she couldn’t enter the inner city despite receiving the title of Valley Master.


 In terms of skill alone, she could have become a Clan Leader or even higher.


 Ting!


 As the string sound rang out once more, a few of the red-belted warriors nearby frowned.


 It was due to the true energy infused into the sound each time she plucked the string.


 She, who could infuse internal energy into sound, was the Summoning Sound Valley Master Hang Yeo-ryang.


 Corpse Blood Valley Leader Lee Ji-yeom clicked his tongue inwardly.


 ‘Even that woman has come.’


 Unlike the Shadow Clan Master, Lee Ji-yeom knew her well.


 

 In the orthodox sects and even in the martial arts world, there were those with unique martial arts lineages, and one of them was sound techniques.


 In reality, there were only a handful of people in the Central Plains martial arts world who could properly utilize sound techniques, and the Summoning Sound Valley Master Hang Yeo-ryang was one of them.


 Ting!


 The Summoning Sound Valley Master Hang Yeo-ryang, lying in a seductive pose on the four-person sedan chair, plucked the string of the lute with her finger.


 Then, the ripple that had spread through the sound earlier grew larger.


 As a result,


 “Ugh.”


 Some of the red-belted warriors with relatively weaker internal energy couldn’t endure it and covered their ears.


 ‘She hasn’t changed.’


 It was truly a bad habit.


 She would often unexpectedly infuse sound techniques into the lute strings, making those around her uncomfortable.


Updated from freewёbnoνel.com.

 Even the good-natured Vice Clan Leader had strongly warned her about it.


 Of course, she must have ignored that warning, as she continued this bad habit.


 ‘Huu.’


 Anyway, feeling that he couldn’t just leave her be, Lee Ji-yeom cupped his hands and spoke loudly,


 “It’s been a while, Summoning Sound Valley Master.”


 “Valley Master~ Valley Master~ Valley Master~”


 His voice echoed throughout the entire plaza like a reverberation.


 The majestic true energy contained in his voice caused interest to flicker in the eyes of the Summoning Sound Valley Master Hang Yeo-ryang, who had been lying seductively.


 No, the executives who had arrived earlier were the same.


 With just this greeting, they could infer that Lee Ji-yeom’s internal energy had deepened compared to before.


 Of course, it was the same for Hang Yeo-ryang.


 She spoke as if surprised,


 “Corpse Blood Valley Leader’s internal energy has deepened since the last time we met.”


 “How could that be?”


 “Your modesty is excessive.”


 “It’s not modesty. Rather, upon hearing the beautiful sound of the lute strings, I feel that the Summoning Sound Valley Master’s cultivation is deepening day by day. The power infused in the sound makes even my insides churn.”


 “Hohoho. Is that so?”


 Although he spoke indirectly, his true intention was simple.


 The people around could suffer internal injuries, so stop infusing power into the strings and cease it.


 That was the meaning.


 She also instantly understood this, but…


 Ting!


 “Then, as an apology to the Valley Master, I should play a proper tune for you.”


 ‘This woman, really…’


 It was truly a troublesome situation.


 As per custom, he had sent an invitation letter asking for her attendance, but naturally, he had assumed she wouldn’t come given her personality.


 But she suddenly appeared and acted as she pleased according to her unique temperament, making it extremely difficult for him.


 At this, Lee Ji-yeom looked at the Thunderbolt Fist King Won Byeong-hak, one of the Five Kings, seeking his help.


 He was asking for a higher-ranking executive to intervene.


 However,


 ‘!?’


 He saw Won Byeong-hak sitting still, turning his head away and feigning ignorance.


 No matter how self-centered she was, if he, a superior executive and one of the Five Kings, stepped forward and warned her, it would be difficult for her to ignore it.


 But he couldn’t understand why he was acting like this.


 ‘I’m sorry, Corpse Blood Valley Leader.’


 In fact, Won Byeong-hak had met her beforehand and received a confirmation that she wouldn’t touch the child from an Esoteric Realm Gate.


 They had things to give and take, so he couldn’t bring himself to intervene.


 If she, with her self-centered nature, became displeased and targeted the child from the Esoteric Realm Gate that he had his eyes on, it would become troublesome.


 Seeing that the Thunderbolt Fist King Won Byeong-hak wasn’t intervening, Lee Ji-yeom reluctantly looked at the Shadow Clan Master, one of the Three Chief Masters, a level above him.


 But the Shadow Clan Master merely covered his mouth with his hand and laughed like a woman.


 He didn’t seem to have any intention of intervening.


 ‘No other choice.’


 Lee Ji-yeom clicked his tongue inwardly.


 Since it had come to this, even if he became uncomfortable with her, it seemed he had no choice but to take a strong stance.


 Towards her, who was plucking the lute strings…


 “Summoning Sound Valley Master. That’s enough.”


 At that moment, someone’s voice was heard.


 At this, she, who had been plucking the lute, frowned and turned her head.


 The one standing there was none other than…


 ‘The Bright Blade King?’


 The Bright Blade King Son Yun, one of the Five Kings, was standing there with a large sword on his shoulder, glaring at her with a grim expression.


 His imposing presence, with a larger build than the average person and covered in scars, was unmatched among anyone present.


 “The Bright Blade King… has also come.”


 The Summoning Sound Valley Master Hang Yeo-ryang stopped plucking the lute and bowed with her hands together.


 Lee Ji-yeom inwardly welcomed Son Yun’s appearance.


 Son Yun was renowned for his resolve even among the Five Kings.


 He disliked crossing the line and had a clear sense of likes and dislikes. He had clashed with the self-centered Hang Yeo-ryang several times before.


 There were even rumors that she had nearly lost her head to the Bright Blade King Son Yun’s sword.


 In a way, he could be considered her natural enemy.


 “Did I come to a place I shouldn’t have?”


 “No, how could that be?”


 “Then, do it in moderation and sit in your seat. Isn’t the Corpse Blood Valley Leader unable to proceed with the final gate because of you?”


 At his sharp tone, Hang Yeo-ryang’s eyes sharpened.


 It seemed the rumors about their poor relationship weren’t false.


 The atmosphere had become quite cold.


 It was almost a touch-and-go situation.


 At that moment, Corpse Blood Valley Leader Lee Ji-yeom stepped between the two and spoke with his hands cupped,


 “It’s an honor to have the Bright Blade King also observe.”


 The heavy atmosphere was temporarily alleviated.


 The Bright Blade King Son Yun, who had been intensely staring at Hang Yeo-ryang, turned his head, relaxed his expression, and said,


 “Corpse Blood Valley Leader. It’s been a while.”


 “It has been a while. I didn’t expect the Bright Blade King to come to the final ceremony.”


 The reason Corpse Blood Valley Leader Lee Ji-yeom said this was simple.


 The Bright Blade King Son Yun already had outstanding disciples.


 Especially in the case of his chief disciple Woo Ho-rang, his talent was so exceptional that he was considered one of the top five promising successors within the Heaven and Earth Society.


 

  But for him to participate in the final ceremony was puzzling.


 “There’s a reason for that.”


 “A reason?”


 At Lee Ji-yeom’s words, the Bright Blade King Son Yun turned his head and looked at someone among the six boys standing in the plaza.


 That someone was none other than Mok Gyeong-un.


 [What? He lost to whom?]


 Until just the day before, he had no intention of coming here.


 However, upon hearing that his youngest disciple Yeop Wi-seon had not only caused a major incident but had also been defeated by someone, his mind changed.


 ‘Haa…’


 Not long ago, Mok Gyeong-un was just a Peak Realm master.


 Yet he had defeated Yeop Wi-seon, who had reached the Transcendent Realm and had received martial arts instruction from him?


 He couldn’t help but come here.
