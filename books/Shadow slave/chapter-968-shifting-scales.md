## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Những ngày tiếp theo trôi qua trong tiếng súng nổ và tiếng hú điên cuồng của Quái Vật Ác Mộng (Nightmare Creatures). Đoàn người di chuyển không ngừng trên vùng đất tối tăm của Cực Nam, với ánh sao và cực quang dần xuất hiện sau những đám mây tro tàn, rồi lại bị màn tuyết nuốt chửng.

Bão tuyết ngày càng dữ dội, khiến Sunny lo sợ sẽ chạm trán Titan thứ hai trong khu vực. Tốc độ tự tin ban đầu của đoàn đã biến mất. Thay vì những cuộc chạm trán hiếm hoi với Quái Vật Ác Mộng yếu ớt, họ giờ phải đối mặt với cuộc chiến gần như không thể ngăn cản với lũ thủy quái tràn ngập phía bắc Cực Nam.

Áp lực lên những người Tỉnh Giấc (Awakened) và phi công MRW tăng lên đáng kể, và lính bộ binh cũng phải đổ máu. Tệ nhất là sự ăn mòn không thể tránh khỏi từ Vô Số Cổng (Multitude of Gates) lên công nghệ của họ. Các xe quân sự được bảo vệ khỏi ảnh hưởng của Tiếng Gọi (Call) ở một mức độ nào đó, nhưng rất ít xe có được những sửa đổi hiếm và đắt tiền như Rhino.

Số lượng thương vong cũng tăng lên. Trong cuộc hành quân gian khổ đến Cánh Đồng Erebus (Erebus Field), Sunny chỉ mất một vài người. Nhưng ở chặng đường hiện tại, con số đó đã khác. Đoàn người trở nên quá lớn, và các cuộc giao tranh diễn ra quá thường xuyên và khốc liệt để tránh khỏi thương vong. Cứ mỗi khi Gere liên lạc để cập nhật tình hình, danh sách lại dài thêm. Sunny cảm thấy khó chịu vì điều đó. Cậu nghĩ rằng với số lượng người tăng lên, việc mất đi từng người lính sẽ không ảnh hưởng đến cậu quá nhiều, đặc biệt nếu số lượng thương vong thấp hơn dự kiến. Cậu cũng nghĩ rằng cuối cùng mình sẽ trở nên chai sạn trước tin những người dưới quyền mình chết. Nhưng cậu đã không làm được. Cậu cảm thấy phẫn uất khi phải chứng kiến những người đàn ông và phụ nữ tốt đẹp hy sinh, trong khi những kẻ thực sự mạnh mẽ thì lại bận tâm đến những tranh chấp nội bộ. "Đồ khốn kiếp..."

Có lẽ cậu không phù hợp để làm một người lãnh đạo. Cậu đang làm tốt việc dẫn dắt đoàn người và giả vờ là một chỉ huy dũng cảm, nhưng tất cả đều xa lạ với cậu. Sống một mình trong Bóng Tối (Dark) thoải mái hơn nhiều.

Một điều kỳ lạ khác là số lượng người dưới quyền Sunny không hề giảm đi, mà còn tăng lên nhanh chóng. Càng đi xa, đoàn người càng lớn mạnh. Có những nhóm người khác trốn thoát khỏi Cánh Đồng Erebus, những đội lính mất liên lạc với Bộ Chỉ Huy Quân Đội (Army Command) do bão tuyết, và những đoàn xe sơ tán bị mắc kẹt sau khi điểm đến của họ bị phá hủy. Tất cả đều vui mừng khi thấy một lực lượng được tổ chức tốt di chuyển về phía bắc, đặc biệt là khi nó được dẫn dắt bởi một Bậc Thầy (Master).

Vì vậy, họ gia nhập đoàn người. Sunny không thể từ chối những người lạc lối, và vào thời điểm đó, việc đó cũng không có ý nghĩa gì. Bốn nghìn người tị nạn dưới sự bảo vệ của cậu đã tăng lên năm, rồi sáu, rồi mười hai nghìn. Năm trăm người lính đã trở thành hơn một nghìn. Ba когорт Tỉnh Giấc (cohorts of Awakened) đã tăng lên bảy, và có hai когорт Người Ngủ (Sleeper cohorts) phụ trợ thay vì một. Số lượng xe cũng tăng lên. Đoàn xe phình to kéo dài hai km và không có dấu hiệu dừng lại. "Đây đúng là công thức cho thảm họa..."

Với tốc độ này, cậu sẽ chỉ huy cả một sư đoàn khi đến được Falcon Scott. Nếu họ đến được đó. Hy vọng rằng cậu sẽ vớ được một hoặc hai полковник và đẩy trách nhiệm chỉ huy cho họ. Tất nhiên, với điều kiện полковник đó không phải là một tên ngốc.

Sunny vừa tiêu diệt xong một Con Quỷ Sa Ngã (Fallen Demon) rất khó chịu đang phục kích trên đường đi của đoàn người và trở lại đầu đội hình. Ngay khi cậu xuất hiện từ trong bóng tối trên nóc xe Rhino, Quạ (Crow) bay xuống đậu trên vai cậu, lông xù lên và phủ đầy tuyết.

Cậu liếc nhìn con chim đáng thương và thở dài: "Gì? Ngươi thấy gì à?"

Con quái vật nhỏ gật đầu: "Crro! Thấy!"

Sunny đợi Quạ nói tiếp, biết rằng hẳn là có chuyện chẳng lành thì Echo mới tìm đến cậu. Con quái vật bay lại kêu lên: "Mord! Hord!" (Bầy đàn! Bầy đàn!)

Nói xong, con chim quay đầu và chỉ mỏ về một hướng. "Chết tiệt." Có một bầy Quái Vật Ác Mộng (Nightmare Creatures) ở phía trước... một bầy mà Quạ không biết cách tránh. Cuối cùng, nỗi sợ hãi của Sunny đã thành sự thật.

Cậu vội vàng phái bóng (shadow) ở gần hướng mà Echo chỉ đến phía trước. Nó đã trinh sát từ rất xa, nhưng rõ ràng là chưa đủ xa. Chẳng mấy chốc, mắt Sunny nheo lại. Quả thực có một bầy quái vật rộng lớn, và việc vượt qua nó là không thể. Trừ khi cậu sử dụng đường cao tốc ven biển. Trong trường hợp đó, đoàn người sẽ có cơ hội lướt qua biển quái vật mà không bị làm phiền. Một cơ hội mong manh. Họ cũng sẽ có nguy cơ chạm trán với một thứ thậm chí còn tồi tệ hơn. "...Chết tiệt."

### Chương 968: Cán cân thay đổi

Thêm vài ngày nữa trôi qua trong tiếng ồn ào của vũ khí khai hỏa và tiếng hú điên cuồng của những Sinh Vật Ác Mộng đang chết dần. Khung cảnh tăm tối của Trung Tâm Nam Cực trôi qua đoàn xe di chuyển không ngừng, với ánh sao và hình ảnh nhấp nhô của Cực Quang (Aurora Australis) cuối cùng cũng xuất hiện từ phía sau những đám mây tro tàn, chỉ để bị nuốt chửng bởi tấm màn tuyết.

Cơn bão tuyết lại mạnh lên, khiến Sunny tự hỏi liệu cậu có sắp chạm trán với con titan thứ hai đang nổi giận trong khu vực này không. Nói thật lòng thì cậu chẳng hào hứng gì với việc làm quen với nó cả.

Cuộc hành trình... thật kỳ lạ. Sunny đã quen với việc mọi thứ nhanh chóng trở nên tồi tệ, nhưng tình hình của đoàn xe lại rất khác. Thay vì một điều gì đó kinh khủng và tàn khốc xảy ra cùng một lúc, hoàn cảnh của họ ngày càng trở nên thảm khốc hơn một chút theo từng giờ, đưa họ đến gần sự hủy diệt từng chút một.

Tốc độ tự tin mà đoàn xe đã thiết lập sau khi rời khỏi trạm tiếp tế đã biến mất từ lâu. Thay vì những cuộc giao tranh hiếm hoi với những đàn Sinh Vật Ác Mộng yếu ớt, giờ đây họ đang vướng vào một trận chiến gần như không thể ngăn cản với những con quái vật biển đang tràn ngập các khu vực phía bắc của Trung Tâm Nam Cực.

Áp lực lên những người Thức Tỉnh (Awakened) và các phi công MRW đã tăng lên đáng kể, và lính bộ binh đã phải nhuốm máu lưỡi lê của họ không chỉ một lần.

Tệ nhất là sự ăn mòn không thể tránh khỏi mà vô số Cổng (Gates) đang gây ra cho công nghệ của họ. Các phương tiện quân sự được bảo vệ khỏi những ảnh hưởng bất lợi của Tiếng Gọi (Call) ở một mức độ nào đó, nhưng rất ít phương tiện có những sửa đổi hiếm và đắt tiền như Rhino. Hiện tại họ vẫn xoay sở được, nhưng không ai biết điều đó sẽ kéo dài bao lâu.

Các vấn đề đang chồng chất.

... Thương vong cũng đang tăng lên.

Trong cuộc hành quân gian khổ đến Cánh Đồng Erebus (Erebus Field), Sunny chỉ mất một số ít người vì sự thất thường của Ma Thuật (Spell) và lò lửa chiến đấu chết chóc. Số lượng tổn thất của họ ít đến mức mỗi người đều được coi là một sự kiện đau lòng.

Nhưng tình hình hiện tại của cuộc hành trình thì khác.

Đoàn xe đã phát triển quá lớn, và các cuộc giao tranh mà họ phải đối mặt quá thường xuyên và căng thẳng để tránh mất binh lính. Tỷ lệ hao hụt không quá kinh khủng, và trên thực tế vẫn ở mức thấp đáng ngưỡng mộ, nhưng dường như mỗi khi Gere liên lạc với cậu để cập nhật tình hình của đoàn, lại có thêm nhiều cái tên phải được thêm vào danh sách.

Sunny cảm thấy lạ lùng khó chịu vì điều đó. Cậu đã nghĩ rằng với sự gia tăng đáng kể về số lượng, việc mất đi từng người lính sẽ không ảnh hưởng đến cậu quá nhiều, đặc biệt nếu số lượng thương vong thấp hơn dự kiến. Cậu cũng đã nghĩ rằng cuối cùng mình sẽ trở nên tê liệt trước tin tức về những người dưới quyền mình chết đi.

Nhưng cậu đã không làm được.

Càng có nhiều binh lính của cậu chết đi - dù ít đến đâu - cậu càng cảm thấy cay đắng và tức giận. Tuy nhiên, cảm xúc mạnh mẽ nhất mà cậu trải qua lại khá bất ngờ: phẫn uất.

Sunny cảm thấy phẫn uất trước sự thật rằng cậu bị buộc phải chứng kiến những người đàn ông và phụ nữ tốt chết đi, chứng kiến những người trần mắt thịt đặt mạng sống của họ lên hàng đầu để bảo vệ những người tị nạn không có khả năng tự vệ... trong khi những kẻ thực sự mạnh mẽ lại không thấy bóng dáng đâu, vướng vào những cuộc tranh giành nội bộ của riêng họ.

'Lũ khốn chết tiệt...'

Có lẽ cậu không phù hợp để trở thành một nhà lãnh đạo.

... Điều đó không có nghĩa là Sunny không hiệu quả. Ngược lại, cậu đang làm rất tốt việc lãnh đạo đoàn xe và giả vờ là một chỉ huy dũng cảm. Tuy nhiên, tất cả đều xa lạ với cậu. Đó là điều cậu đang làm vì hoàn cảnh buộc cậu phải làm, chứ không phải vì cậu muốn đóng vai đó.

Sống một mình trong Bóng Tối (Dark) thoải mái hơn nhiều.

'À, những ngày tháng tốt đẹp đã qua.'

Có một điều kỳ lạ nữa về cuộc hành quân về phía bắc của đoàn xe... điều mà Sunny đáng lẽ phải lường trước được, nhưng dù sao cũng không tính đến.

Bất chấp sự hao hụt chậm chạp, số lượng người dưới quyền chỉ huy của cậu không hề giảm đi. Thay vào đó, nó đang tăng lên... thậm chí là phình to ra. Càng đi xa, đoàn xe càng trở nên lớn hơn.

Có những nhóm người lớn khác đã trốn thoát khỏi Cánh Đồng Erebus, những đội quân lính đã mất liên lạc với Bộ Chỉ Huy Quân Đội do bão tuyết, và những đoàn xe sơ tán bị mắc kẹt trong tình trạng lấp lửng sau khi điểm đến của họ bị phá hủy. Tất cả đều vui mừng khi thấy một lực lượng được tổ chức tốt đang di chuyển về phía bắc, đặc biệt là khi nó được dẫn dắt bởi một Bậc Thầy (Master).

Vì vậy, họ đã gia nhập đoàn xe. Sunny không thể thực sự xua đuổi những người lạc đường, và vào thời điểm đó, cũng chẳng có lý do gì để làm vậy.

Vì vậy, bốn nghìn người tị nạn dưới sự bảo vệ của cậu đã biến thành năm, rồi sáu, rồi mười hai nghìn người. Năm trăm binh lính đã biến thành hơn một nghìn người.
