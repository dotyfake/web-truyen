## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Sau khi chọn đúng phong bì chứa nhiệm vụ, nhân vật chính nhận được lệnh "Trừng phạt Ngụy Ma" (Punishment of false demons) quen thuộc. Sima Minh giải thích rằng một tổ chức kỳ lạ tên Thiên Mệnh Hội (Cheonmyeonghoe 天命會) mạo danh Ma giáo và gây rối, yêu cầu cậu tiêu diệt thủ lĩnh và giải tán tổ chức này.

Nhân vật chính nhận thức được sự khác biệt so với lần trước, lần này cậu không xem thường đối thủ. Sima Minh cũng cho phép cậu sử dụng mạng lưới tình báo của Thông Thiên Các (Tongcheon Pavilion), Ma binh đoàn (Demon Army) và cả Vùng Palma (Palma Zone).

Cha của cậu dặn dò, không hề nhắc nhở cẩn thận, thay vào đó mong muốn cậu trở về sau khi giải quyết xong mọi việc. Cậu đáp lại bằng ánh mắt kiên định, thể hiện quyết tâm trở thành người kế vị. Cậu cũng liếc nhìn huynh trưởng Cổ Mộ Dương (Geommuyang), mong muốn cả hai sẽ hoàn thành tốt nhiệm vụ.

Sáng hôm sau, Yến (Ian) đến tiễn cậu. Yến lo lắng cho sự an toàn của cậu, khác hẳn vẻ tinh nghịch trước đây. Cậu dặn dò Yến hãy tập trung vào tu luyện. Cậu cũng biết Thanh Diện (Cheongmyeon) đã đến gặp Yến và khuyên Yến đừng quá lo lắng về trách nhiệm khi Thanh Diện quyết định đến bên cô.

Trước khi rời đi, cậu ghé thăm các Amazon. Đầu tiên là đến chỗ Ác Kình Khốc (Akinkok) của Cực Ác Thần Ma (Extreme Evil Soma), nhưng Thanh Diện đã rời đi vài ngày trước mà không để lại lời nhắn. Cậu nhắn lại với Ác Kình Khốc rằng cậu đã ghé thăm. Sau đó, cậu hỏi Thanh Diện về tổ chức Quỷ Ảnh Đội (Gwiyeongdae) và nhận được câu trả lời rằng đó là lực lượng chính của cậu trong tương lai, do người cậu quan tâm nhất lãnh đạo.

Tiếp theo, cậu đến chỗ Nhất Hoa Kiếm Tôn (Ilhwageomjeon). Cậu nhớ lại chuyện xưa của bà và hỏi liệu bà có hạnh phúc hơn nếu mọi chuyện suôn sẻ với Huyết Thiên Đồ Ma (Hyeolcheon Doma) hay không. Cậu biết Chủy Ma (Chwima) đã đến tặng rượu cho bà và kể hết mọi chuyện. Cậu nhờ Nhất Hoa Kiếm Tôn nói tốt về Huyết Thiên Đồ Ma, dù bà không thích ông ta.

Sau đó, cậu đến chỗ Chủy Ma thì biết rằng ông ta đã bế quan tu luyện. Cuối cùng, cậu đến chỗ Huyết Thiên Đồ Ma, người đang miệt mài luyện tập. Huyết Thiên Đồ Ma dặn dò cậu cẩn thận và tặng cậu một viên Tốc Không Đan (Sokongdan), một loại đan dược quý hiếm giúp hồi phục nội lực nhanh chóng. Cậu cũng trêu chọc Huyết Thiên Đồ Ma về mối quan hệ của ông với Chủy Ma.

Sau khi rời khỏi Ma giáo, cậu một mình lên đường, tranh thủ luyện tập thêm các chiêu thức còn lại của Phong Thần Tứ Tuyệt (Wind God’s Four Treasures). Dựa trên thông tin từ Thông Thiên Các, cậu biết Thiên Mệnh Hội đã gây ra nhiều vụ việc ở vùng Hồ Nam, đặc biệt là ở Vĩnh Hưng (Yeongheung) và Đông Cú (Donggu). Nhớ lại sai lầm trong quá khứ khi mất thời gian ở Vĩnh Hưng, lần này cậu quyết định đến thẳng Đông Cú và tìm đến Nguyệt Phong Môn (Wolpungmun), nơi xảy ra vụ việc gần đây nhất.

**NOTICE: Many of the novels have been removed because they might cause violations, which we were not aware of earlier.**




[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-140/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-142/)Episode 141: This time, make the right choice.




I chose the path I knew.


Even before the regression, I chose the right mission, and today I chose the right envelope again.


I can handle any mission now!


This was not the time to show such confidence. It was an opportunity to humbly make up for past failures.


The envelope contained a piece of paper with these four letters written on it.


Punishment of false demons.


It was the order that had been given to me before.


Sima Ming sent a messenger to explain, so that the two men would not know about each other’s mission.


―Recently, a strange organization called Cheonmyeonghoe (天命會) has begun to operate in the martial arts world. They claim to be creating a new martial arts world by receiving the mandate of heaven, but they are actually people who seek personal gain. Recently, they have caused various incidents by impersonating the Demon Lord of our school, and it has reached a point where we can no longer ignore them. Your Majesty, please find their leader, kill them, and eliminate Cheonmyeonghoe.


In fact, when I heard this message before the return, I thought they were funny. It was not because they were showing off their skills, but because they were pretending to be the demons of our school.




But now I take it differently. If they dare to impersonate Amazon, it means they have the confidence to handle it or there may be other hidden schemes. These guys are not ordinary guys.


“I will obey your orders.”


When I received the mission, Geommuyang chose the remaining envelopes. Of course, I know exactly what mission is written on those envelopes.


After Sima Ming had relayed basic information to Geommuyang, he spoke to the two of us.


“You must complete the mission alone. However, while the two of you are carrying out the mission, you can utilize all of the information networks of our school’s Tongcheon Pavilion, and you can use the four powerful magicians of our school, including the Demon Army, and the Palma Zone once.”


It meant that you could solve it on your own, but you could receive help from the church when subduing those guys.


After Sima Ming finished speaking, my father said:


“A frog in a well or a plant in a greenhouse cannot lead our school. Come back after resolving the issue!”


My father never once told me to be careful when he entrusted me with this dangerous mission. I smiled and relaxed the tense atmosphere.


“Father, which of us would you like to see succeed?”




The corners of my father’s mouth rose slightly at my question. I could feel that he was holding back something he wanted to say.


In fact, my father’s gaze looking down at us was fair. He didn’t give me or my brother a private look.


Before I returned, I wasn’t looking at my father at this moment. I was only thinking about how I had to complete the mission.


But now I was looking at my father.


Father, don’t worry. I will solve this problem and return safely.


He conveyed that belief with his eyes. This was also an effort to become the successor. The more my father trusted me, the closer I would get to the position of successor.


My gaze, which had been directed at my father, turned to Geommuyang.


‘Brother, do well like you used to and come back. I will do well and come back too. Ah, don’t look at me so coldly without knowing how I feel.’


\* \* \*


The next morning, as I was preparing to leave, Ian came to see me.




“Did you call?”


“I’m going to be away for a while and then come back.”


“Where are you going?”


“I can’t reveal it.”


I raised my finger and pointed upward. Ian realized that I was leaving to carry out the order given from the Heavenly Demon Hall.


“Please buy me something delicious when you come!”


“I’m not going out to have fun. I’m going to do something extremely dangerous.”


“I’m busy with my martial arts training, so I’ll go first.”


“These scary enemies are just pouring out.”


“Bye!”


Ian, who had run to the door like that, sighed and turned around.


“How great it would be if we could go like this! How dangerous it would be! I’ll go with you and help.”


She had changed from Ian, who used to be playful, to Ian, who worried about me all the time.


“You have to do it alone. And I’m kidding. Don’t worry.”


“Really?”


“Stop worrying and just focus on your work.”


“Mr. Cheongmyeon came to visit me a while ago.”


I watched the two of them meet, but I pretended not to notice.


“Are you going to encourage it?”


“No, I’m still thinking about it. I just asked a few questions and left.”




“How do you feel?”


“It’s half and half. Actually, I really want you to come now, but I think I’ll be more worried when you actually come. Because you’re going to start a new life because of me.”


“To worry about what happens next is to ignore Cheongmyeon’s worries. At first glance, it seems like you should be responsible for that person, but that’s not the case at all.”


“Isn’t that so?”


“Yes, Cheongmyeon is coming after careful consideration. He has thought hard about it and decided that it would be more beneficial for him to come to you, so he is coming. If he comes and decides that it is not right, he will go back. So don’t feel burdened.”


Ian smiled at my words.


“Be strong, Ian. Then nine out of ten problems you’re struggling with will just fall into place.”


After saying goodbye to Ian, I left the residence.


I was planning to see the Amazons once before I left. They were people I didn’t necessarily need to bring, but I wanted to see them once before I left.


The first place we stopped by was the Akinkok of the Extreme Evil Soma.


He was always the one staring at the wall in that white room, but today, Cheongmyeon announced his absence.


“The Amazon left the church a few days ago.”


“Can you tell me where you went?”


“You left without even telling me.”


“When you get back, tell them I stopped by.”

“Yes, I will do that.”


As I turned around to leave, Cheongmyeon asked me.


“I would like to ask you one thing.”


“Speak.”


“You may find this question strange, but what kind of organization is Gwiyeongdae to a person with engineering skills?”


I knew why he was asking that question, so I answered him honestly.


“This is the organization that will become my main force in the future. It is also the organization led by the person I care most about. It will probably become the busiest organization in the martial arts world. It is to the point where I will naturally say that I enjoyed working under the evil Soma.”


The eyes behind the mask of Cheongmyeon were seen smiling.


“Thank you for telling me.”


Cheongmyeon bowed her head and greeted him. She could have said a few words to Ian, but she didn’t. Only by making her own judgment and decision, would any regrets be worthwhile.


Next, we stopped by Ilhwageomjeon.


After hearing about her past from Chwima, I started to think about her life.


If things had worked out well with Hyeolcheon Doma, would she have been happier than she is now?


“You look younger these days.”


“Don’t talk nonsense. I’ve been getting a lot of wrinkles lately and I’m worried.”


However, Ilhwageomjon’s face brightened at the compliment on his appearance that he hadn’t seen in a long time.


“You said you were drunk and had some alcohol?”


“How did you know?”


“The drunkard has come. He brought some good alcohol and left. He did something he never did before.”


“What did he say when he gave you the drink?”




“He was so happy and proud that he became close friends with you.”


“I don’t know if that’s a good thing. If you and I are like brothers, the distribution will get messed up.”


“Then let’s be friends.”


“Don’t say that, even if it’s a joke. I said it as a joke.”


Chwima probably didn’t come here to brag about his brotherhood. He probably confessed everything to me and felt sorry for her.


It remained to be seen how Chwima would act.


“As you know, Chuma and Doma don’t get along well. Is that okay?”


“Senior, you need to help me.”


“how?”


“Even if you don’t feel like it, please say something nice about Elder Doma. I know you don’t like it. But please do it for my face.”


Ilhwageomjon didn’t answer at all. It seems that even my face can’t erase my antipathy towards Doma.


Still, I hope things will get better than before. If Chwima stops badmouthing Hyeoncheon Doma and starts talking positively about him, her feelings toward Doma may also gradually change.


Next, we stopped by Chwima.


But Yeo-bin told me unexpected news.


“His Majesty has entered the closed-door training.”


I was startled because it was such a sudden remark.


“Suddenly closed training?”


“I’ve been drinking too much lately, so I need to get some exercise.”


“Isn’t that a good thing?”


“Yes, that’s exactly what I was hoping for. Thank you, Your Majesty.”




“Don’t worry. We promised to drink less and eat more snacks when we drink, so please take good care of me.”


“Yes, I will do that.”


I’ve felt this way since long ago. That this Yeo-bin likes Chwi-ma. Does Chwi-ma know that she feels that way? I wonder if he’s pretending not to know, even though he knows it like a snake.


Among the demons, the last one to stop by was the residence of the Bloodthirsty Demon.


“The elder’s path is becoming more and more fierce.”


Today, too, Hyeolcheon Doma was in the midst of his training.


“As you grow, your enemies will become fiercer.”


“Are you really training to face my enemy? Are you planning to fight the demons who support your brother?”


“It’s not just because of the fight for succession.”


“sure?”


“Do you remember what I said before? When a dragon ascends, it brings with it wind and rain.”


“Yes, that’s what the old man said. My people were being swept away by the wind and rain.”


“That’s right. You said that the loach was causing a stir in the muddy water, but I think that the sleeping dragons of the martial arts world will wake up in that stir.”


“Aren’t you overestimating me?”


“Considering what you’ve shown so far, this is also an underestimation. Be careful when you go out. It seems like the main school, the Murim Alliance, and the Sadomaeng are controlling the Murim, but compared to all the Murim people, they are only a small number. You never know where someone stronger than us might pop up. Don’t forget. A place with as many eccentric people as grains of sand is a martial arts world.”


“I will always make careful decisions and take action.”


“And wait a minute.”


Bloodthirsty Demon entered the room and came out with a small box. When he opened it, there was a single elixir inside.


“It’s a quick-acting elixir. Use it if you’re in a hurry.”


The Sokongdan was a elixir that, when taken when one’s internal energy was depleted, would restore internal energy two to three times faster than usual.




Because there were no side effects, it was only available at a high price, and even then, it was not common, so it was not easy to obtain.


“Save it and use it for your elders.”


“Are you planning to exploit the old man by feeding him even the secret weapon? Take it and use it yourself.”


He forcefully put the speed bump into my hand. I could feel his concern and affection for me, and my heart ached.


Don’t worry, sir. I will take care and come back safely.


Since I was receiving it, I enjoyed the atmosphere.


“Is there anything else you would like? Please go in and look for more.”


“It’s not there! It’s not there anymore!”


“I see you are strongly denying it, so there is. I look forward to it next time.”


As I was smiling and greeting him and turning around to leave, Hyeolcheondoma asked.


“What happened with that wicked guy?”


“We decided to be friendly with each other from now on.”


Bloodthirsty Horse made a dumbfounded expression, then an expression of admiration.


“If you were a loach, you would never have been able to get along with that wicked guy.”


Although he may not like drinking, it meant that it was a great thing that he got along with drinking.


“I trust you and do whatever I want.”


“So that’s why you’re swinging this heavy sword with this old body?”


After leaving the Bloodthirsty Demon’s residence, I left the church.


As soon as I reached a deserted place, I started to run in earnest. These days, I like moving alone, even if it’s because of the speedboat.


But even when I was running, I definitely rested when I had to. This is because all of my actions this time were reported to the Heavenly Horse. There was no need to let everyone know that I could run incredibly fast.




After running at full speed and arriving at a designated location, I spent the rest of the time practicing the remaining Wind God’s Four Treasures there.


The Dark Shadow became more stealthy, the Flashing Light became faster, and the Underworld Light became more ferocious. I trained and trained again. I exerted all my effort and concentration. For the time being, my martial arts goal was definitely the Great Star of the Wind God Four Treasures.


According to the information sent from Tongcheon-gak, Cheonmyeonghoe caused several incidents in the Honam region.


The two places where recent incidents occurred were Yeongheung and Donggu.


In the past, I went to Yeongheung to dig up the case and track down Cheonmyeonghoe. However, in conclusion, it was revealed that the Yeongheung case was not the work of Cheonmyeonghoe. It was the work of those who imitated Cheonmyeonghoe.


Because of that, I wasted a lot of time in the past, and went to the East too late to follow their trail. Because of that, I became impatient and missed the clues I should have found, and ultimately failed the mission.


Of course, this time I made the right choice.


After arriving at Donggu, I went straight to Wolpungmun (月風門) where the incident occurred.
