A person who survived until he became old in the Demon’s Way, which is called the hell of this world.


If I were to weigh honor and life, I would obviously choose life.


But it was a story that was difficult for anyone to accept at face value.


Although he was a pure-hearted man who spoke with a voice full of fearsome power, the words he had just uttered did not have the resonance of a six-way battle.


It was a very long distance.


To recognize the voice, you had to either enhance your hearing with your senses or look at the shape of the mouth.


As the crowd at the foot of the mountain murmured, even the old guard came out, doubting their eyes and ears.


It was mainly the Taoist priests of Cheongseong, not the Amipa.


“What did that demon with incredible strength say?”


“If my eyesight is not lacking, then I am sure I have lost… … .”




“Have you been competing in the liver competition?”


“It is said that the Sunmaryeonju of that time had achieved the realm of escaping from evil. How could he be afraid of the seemingly opposing true energy?”


Between them, the soft voice of the swordsman came in.


“It’s the true power of magic. And the ten-professional weapon techniques… The Magwangikju created the ultimate conditions. I don’t know how that’s possible.”


It was a story that confirmed what many had guessed. The Ami monks’ disapproval sounded softly once again, and the masters of Cheongseong were stirred.


“Magical powers…? I’ve heard rumors that you can wield divine powers… … .”


“I had to look closely. Is it true that Ma Gwang-ik-ju uses energy that is comparable to the power of the Three Pure Ones?”


Voices filled with gentle excitement.


The Taoist Three Purities are the most auspicious powers in the world.


Even among the old schools of Taoism, it was said that only the eldest of the shamanist factions had attained enlightenment.




“quietly.”


The head of the Cheongseongpa clan standing at the edge of the cave entrance spoke.


A back view with long, sharp ears. The sudden wave of light energy that had occurred was lifting the hem of the white robe high.


“What do you think about the situation?”


He asked quietly, staring intently at Jeongyeonshin, who was surrounded by a halo of light from the Eighteen and Half Weapons.


Cheongseong Jangmunin’s gaze was fixed and did not move at all.


Baekyak Satae, who had suddenly risen from his cross-legged position, opened his mouth.


“That old lord is the one who has lived the longest in the magic world. Anything could happen. Either he is truly seeking his own safety or he has other ulterior motives.”


“Eighteen Half-Armed Techniques… Can we assume that Ma Gwang-ik-ju has fully mastered them?”


“Haven’t you already seen it?”




When Baekyak Sasae was asked again, a calm silence returned. The expression on Cheongseongpa Jangmunin’s face was strange.


He looked deep in thought, carefully observing Jeongyeonshin.


“… A quality that fights against Providence. It is very dangerous. A person who destroys things as if he were breathing. How many sects would tolerate such a being… … .”


Cheongseong Jangmunin trailed off. Baekyak Sidae shook his head as he watched the confrontation between Sunmaryeonju and Jeongyeonsin.


“Ami and Shaolin have no choice but to welcome him.”


“As the Magwangikju stands out, the storm that blows through Baekdo Jeongpa will grow bigger. He will make more enemies than the current Shingeomdanju.”


“It’s certainly something to be concerned about, but I don’t think it’s something to worry about right now. Look at the old resident of the magician’s house. There’s something fishy about him.”


Just after the Baekyak incident ended, an Amipa nun wearing a monk’s robe hurriedly jumped up from under the cliff.


“Monk Jangmun! The thirteen thousand hordes have run rampant!”


“Tell me calmly.”


“It seems that the nearby sects were all wiped out, leaving them empty. Not only the sects of the Mu-ga and Jeong-sa-ji clans, but even the Mu-gwan clans… … All information about the main sect was also cut off.”


“Amitabha.”


“No weasels come up from the Golden Zen Sisters. Hunters with internal energy, led by a short woman, are said to bring about natural disasters… Judging from the letter, it seems that the Golden Shimunju is heading here.”


That was when.


A similar story came out of Jeong Yeon-shin’s mouth as she faced Sunmaryeonju on the hill where the eyes of the old school masters were focused.


“Are you really not going to come out?”


“Oh, my dear, your power is truly extraordinary. However, it does not reach the level of my age.”


Sunmaryeonju said with a sly smile. The magic that had darkened the entire sky had disappeared without a trace.


It had been a long time since he had disappeared into the old man’s black robe.


The surroundings are bright.




As pure white lightning flashed between the weapons surrounding the two people, Jeong Yeon-shin stared blankly at Sunmaryeonju and opened her lips.


“It’s amazing that you have no shame at your age. You said you were in the realm of demonic power, but did the demonic energy invade the Baihui blood?”


“… … .”


“You said it was a punishment, not a punishment. Did you think you could avoid it by wagging your tail like an old dog?”


Jeongyeonshin was observing the inside of the body while asking questions she was curious about.


A life or death battle with the Ten Masters.


Trauma is not a problem because we are used to the pain.


The problem was the accumulation of Manjonghonwongong throughout the body. It felt like long needles were sharply piercing the blood vessels.


The power of the unrivaled master of a hundred battles was as hard as a diamond, disrupting the flow of internal energy.


It will be difficult to exert full power like this.


It was the price paid for defeating the person who was at the top of Sima Oedo. He needed time to briefly attend to the fortune telling ceremony.


‘If you use the Jeonggadonggong properly, it will recover quickly, but… … .’


Phew―


Jeongyeonshin felt a gaze that seemed to extend from the abyss. The pitch-black light was scanning her body. It was the gaze of a pure-hearted person.


It’s not hard to beat that old man here. Even if you confront him right away, you’ll see that you have a better chance of winning.

The only problem is that he faces Geumsimunju right after beheading Sunmaryeonju.


‘mother.’


Jeong Yeon-shin activated Jeong Ga-dong-gong while standing.


Sarak-


As soon as the key point comes to mind, your body begins to gently heal itself.


A dreamy feeling. The process of stitching up the torn meridians with true energy and restoring the elasticity of the blood vessels was slow.


It was a significantly slower speed than when he was flying alone. This was because there was a peerless master right in front of him.


Sunmaryeonju, who had been watching him intently, smiled brightly.


“Punishment? It’s been only a month or so since I ascended to the throne. I have never personally touched the Iphwangseong, and I only laughed at the way my subordinates fought. More than that… … .”


The old man with wrinkled lips continued speaking slowly.


“I’m curious about your studies. Have you really mastered all of Manbyeong Aesongi’s military techniques?”


There was a deep interest in his aged voice. It seemed as if he was asking a very important question.


“Do you know the whereabouts of Geumsimunju?”


Jeong Yeon-shin asked back instead. It seemed as if she didn’t see any value in the old man’s question.


The pure-hearted man’s eyebrows twitched.


The old man was faced with words and actions he had never experienced before in his long life.


I should have immediately used the technique of the Underworld’s Demonic Force to make Aesong’s head a mess, but the light of the eighteen-half-armed weapons surrounding him was so divine that it was almost unprecedented.


“…Geumsimunju’s journey to the world of martial arts has always been consistent.”


“Stop beating around the bush and explain properly.”


“They will destroy the sects that are hindering the search for the Dharma treasure. If you want to open the lair of a spirit, you need a powerful weapon.”




“That old man doesn’t know shame either. He must have seen the words I wrote.”


“You don’t have to worry. From the moment you ruined the Dragon’s formation, she was bound to come looking for you.”


The old man answered in a polite tone.


It was a conversation between peerless experts.


While the crowd around her held their breath, whether they could hear or not, Jeong Yeon-shin opened her mouth without caring about the gazes of everyone.


“Tell me where you have placed your subordinates. The ten-man army, the pure-hearted army, the golden army, and everything else.”


“… As expected from someone of the bloodline of a traitor, his words are excessive.”


“I told you to come and show me your martial arts skills, but you came up with some ridiculous plan.”


A faint disappointment appeared on Jeongyeonshin’s face. It was a look that seemed even darker because she had maintained an expressionless face until now.


The eyebrows of the pure-hearted are furrowed.


The expressions of the masters lining the nearby mountainside also changed.


A martial artist is someone who pays close attention to every move made by the world’s greatest talents.


If that person is the young man who just single-handedly defeated the Ten Commandments, then he cannot help but unconsciously leave his sect and try to gain their favor.


It is something that causes reactions even to trivial matters. Like some women who are looking at Magwangikju as if possessed at this moment.


A young, peerless master can build up popularity just by what he has.


Today was the beginning.


“Aesong-ah of Iphwangseong, it is because you did not know about the martial arts of Sima Oedo.”


“Don’t use the word ‘Simawei’ anymore. They are nothing but a bunch of rascals without honor.”


Sunmaryeonju kept her mouth shut.


The sunlight rippled with the air. Time began to pass.




\* \* \*


Some of the crowd looking up at Unhoebong rubbed their eyes. Some even showed expressions that could not hide their shock.


Because the view that unfolded on the hill was beyond imagination.


An old nun and a beautiful Taoist priest of a noble family were guarding the dharma. They were sitting on either side of the cross-legged monk, Ma Gwang-ik-ju.


Buljon, Brain Pure Avalokitesvara Baekyak. An old text of the Amipah.


Yangbyeokgeomgun (兩壁劍君) Cheongsu Jinin. A Taoist who has newly ascended to the position of Cheongseong Jangmun.


“… … .”


The air was heavy.


Saaaaa―


The wind that was blowing up the hill sweeps up the cliff and turns back on its own.


Only a faint dust cloud rose and disappeared. It could not even touch the face of Magwangikju, which was dazzlingly illuminated by sunlight.


It was an unprecedented sight.


“Is it Brain Power Avalokitesvara and the Two-Byeok Sword Army…?”


“Tell your family. From now on, all rumors about Magwangikju will be classified as information of the purple color of the Iphwangseong. It does not only refer to inaction, but also to rank.”


“I really have lived a long life and seen it all. I have seen the true spectacle of the absolute rulers of the old sect standing guard over a mere man… … .”


The elders of the old school.


The orange-hued, pure white robe sways gently.


A vast array of waves were gathered in one place.


If the names of Cheongseong and Ami Jangmunin had not been mentioned in the visit to announce the Bimu Jejeon, Sunmaryeonju would have left the position long ago. He thought so himself.


Calling someone in as a guest and then dealing with them as a joint attack? This is something that no one, even a Baekdo martial artist, should ever do unless they are prepared to risk being punished.




So the old man spoke shamelessly, frowning.


“Those who are supposedly the leaders of the old faction have no sense of morality.”


After the thirteen thousand lords were killed.


Anyone could guess that the condition of the Magwangikju was not perfect.


And yet, it was shocking that he seemed capable of handling the pure magic.


But here, I am recovering my body with a lucky breakfast.


It is impossible to interfere. There are very few people in the world who can break through the law of the two elders of the old school.


“… … .”


The two people did not respond. They just stared at Sunmaryeonju with heavy gazes as if they had gained strength.


‘That guy is in perfect condition here…?’


The old man was troubled. Was it time to take out the magic mouse?


Swish―


A strange noise came from the wrinkled palm of the pure-blooded man’s hand.


It was as if I was holding onto empty space and couldn’t see anything, but inside there was air rippling silently.


A spirit. A type of demon.


It’s an invisible weasel.


Just as the monks of the Shaolin and Ami clans raised things like brown squirrels to use as news sources and tracking tools, the absolute ruler of the magic world had demons made up of spirituality and magic energy.


It was usually used to convey orders to subordinates during closing hours.


Those who have mastered the martial arts of Jeongjong will not be able to sense its presence. This is because it is a divine substance of Pure Maryeon that branched off from the Ming school.


Even if the opponent is a peerless expert, Mayu’s power is so weak that she can’t pose much of a threat.




There was also a restriction that they could not move more than a certain distance from their owner.


It’s different now.


Magwangikju is right in front of you. He is lost in the morning rush.


It was worth a try. Even just making a tiny puncture wound on the acupoint would be good.


There was no way I could let go. Sunmaryeonju slowly sent her thoughts toward his hand. Go.


Squeak-


It was a sound that resonated with spirituality. An invisible weasel slid through the air.


It took only a moment for him to dig between the two long swordsmen and reach the shadow of the Magwangikju leaning forward.


‘Aesong-ah, you don’t know the way of Sima Wei.’


When the wrinkled lips of the pure-blooded man turn up slightly.


Swish.


A head rose silently from the shadows.


Her ebony hair swept through the air in long waves, and her porcelain-white skin radiated a smooth sheen.


A realm of rising where everything slows down.


“… … !”


The woman, whose face was prominent, opened her red lips and bit the weasel’s shape hard.
