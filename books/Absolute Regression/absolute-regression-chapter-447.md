## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Dưới ánh bình minh, những cỗ xe ngựa rời khỏi khu nhà chính của Thần Giáo Cheonma (Cheonmasin Church), chở theo vật phẩm từ tổng bộ đến các chi nhánh. Cha của nhân vật chính (Doma) và cậu cũng ở trên một trong số đó, người đánh xe là một người đàn ông mặc đồ thường phục.

Khi xe đi xa khỏi khu chính, cậu hỏi cha mình về cảm xúc trong chuyến đi đầu tiên cùng con trai. Người cha đáp lại một cách lạnh lùng, "Đây có phải là một chuyến đi không?". Cậu nhận thấy hành lý của cha mình khá nhiều, một túi da lớn ở phía sau xe. Cậu hy vọng cha sẽ để lại mọi lo lắng ở tổng bộ và tận hưởng chuyến đi.

Người cha đột nhiên bảo dừng xe. Ông nói với cậu rằng hãy xuống xe để bỏ lại những lo lắng. Cậu bật cười, cảm nhận được tâm trạng tốt của cha. Sau đó, xe tiếp tục di chuyển. Cậu thò đầu ra ngoài cửa sổ và nói với người đánh xe, chú Hui, rằng cậu mong được hợp tác với chú trong tương lai.

Cậu hy vọng đây sẽ là một cuộc hành trình chứ không phải một nhiệm vụ. Cậu kể cho cha nghe về những địa điểm đẹp gần đó, như một hồ nước trên đồi và một quán mì lều trên núi. Cha cậu bất ngờ đáp lại rằng ông từng giỏi làm bánh bao. Cậu hỏi liệu ông đã từng đến những nơi đó chưa, và ông gật đầu, có vẻ muốn đến đó lần nữa.

Xe dừng lại để ngựa nghỉ ngơi, cậu và cha đi dạo quanh đó. Cậu kể rằng Trưởng lão Thomas đã đến gặp cậu trước khi cậu rời đi và khuyên cậu đừng gây sự với cha mình. Người cha mỉm cười, biết rằng Thomas rất quý mến cậu. Cậu đáp lại rằng Doma rất yêu quý cha mình.

Sau đó, người cha hỏi cậu có cảm nhận được gì không. Cậu ngay lập tức nhận ra có sói gần đó. Người cha ngạc nhiên vì cậu đã cảm nhận được từ khoảng cách hai mươi mét. Cậu giải thích rằng giờ đây cậu tự nhiên phát ra năng lượng và nhìn xung quanh ở những nơi xa lạ, nhờ những gì cha cậu đã dạy.

Khi họ trở lại xe, Hui đã đốt lửa trại và chuẩn bị xong bữa ăn. Cậu cảm thấy Hui cũng rất hào hứng. Bữa ăn do Hui chuẩn bị là đồ anh đã mang theo. Cậu nói rằng từ giờ các bữa ăn sẽ trở nên tồi tàn hơn. Cậu trấn an Hui rằng cậu có cha, và cậu không thể quên hương vị món ăn cha nấu. Cậu lấy ra một tấm da hổ cho cha và da sói cho Hui và mình để lót ngồi.

Khi cả ba đang ngồi ăn, trời bắt đầu mưa. Cậu định bảo cha vào xe tránh mưa, nhưng rồi lại thôi. Một màn năng lượng vô hình bao quanh cơ thể người cha, đẩy nước mưa ra xa. Thay vào đó, người cha mở túi và lấy ra một tấm bạt che mưa gió. Cậu reo lên thích thú, nói rằng ngắm mưa là điều tuyệt vời nhất khi cắm trại.

Sau bữa ăn, họ uống trà và ngắm mưa. Cậu hỏi Hui có khó khăn khi chăm sóc cha cậu không. Hui đáp lại một cách thành thật rằng có, khiến cả hai cha con nhìn nhau ngạc nhiên. Hui giải thích rằng cậu nên trả lời như vậy với Thiếu giáo chủ. Sau đó, người cha quay sang hỏi Hui liệu có khó khăn không. Hui có vẻ bối rối nhưng vẫn đáp lại rằng không.

Đêm đó, họ cắm trại. Cậu nằm cạnh cha và ngắm sao. Cậu xin lỗi vì đã không rủ anh trai đi cùng. Người cha im lặng một lúc rồi nói "Không sao đâu". Cậu khắc ghi khoảnh khắc này vào tâm trí: cha cậu nhìn lên bầu trời đêm, cậu ngắm nhìn ông, và những ngôi sao trên trời.

Ngày hôm sau, họ dừng lại ở một thị trấn. Trong khi Hui thuê chuồng ngựa cho ngựa ăn và nghỉ ngơi, cậu và cha đi dạo quanh chợ. Cả hai đều đã đạt đến trạng thái phản công hoàn hảo, và cha cậu quấn một tấm vải cũ quanh thanh hắc kiếm của cậu, để nó không bị chú ý.

Cậu hỏi đây có phải là lần đầu tiên cha cậu ra chợ bên ngoài Magachon (Magachon) không. Ông đáp lại rằng ông đã từng đi rất nhiều khi còn trẻ. Cậu ước gì cha mình là Master Kwon Ma (Kwon Ma) để cậu có thể gặp ông khi còn trẻ và trò chuyện với ông. Cậu hỏi liệu ông có phải là một người nói nhiều như cậu không. Người cha đáp lại rằng ông có thể uống như một kẻ say, nhưng không chắc có thể nói nhiều như cậu.

Họ đi dạo quanh chợ, trò chuyện đủ thứ. Khi có quá nhiều người, họ sẽ dừng lại. Ngay cả trải nghiệm này cũng mới lạ đối với cha cậu. Cậu tự hỏi ông đang nghĩ gì khi nhìn mọi người xung quanh.

Đột nhiên, một người đàn ông tiếp cận họ và mời họ tham gia một trò chơi lừa đảo. Cậu định bảo cha mình trả tiền bữa tối bằng cách tham gia trò chơi, nhưng trước khi cậu kịp nói, cha cậu đã đi về phía những kẻ lừa đảo. Cậu mỉm cười và hỏi người đàn ông đã mời họ rằng liệu tay của kẻ lừa đảo có nhanh hơn mắt của cha cậu không.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-446/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-448/)447  

At dawn, the carriages left the main building of the Cheonmasin Church.




These were wagons carrying supplies sent from the headquarters to each branch.


Among those carriages was one carrying my father and I. The driver was a man dressed in ordinary coachman’s attire.


As I was getting farther away from the main office, I asked my father.


“Father, how do you feel about your first trip with your son?”


My father, who had been silently looking out the window, asked back at my excited question.


“Isn’t this a trip?”


But isn’t Dad’s luggage too much? In the back luggage compartment, there was a large leather bag for Dad.


“Of course, you are going on an important mission. However, since you are leaving after a long time, it would be good to come back after letting go of all the things that have been building up in your heart. Please leave all your worries at the headquarters.”


Then, the father, who was looking out the window, said to Hwi.


“Stop the carriage.”




The carriage stopped immediately.


“Why are you doing that?”


“Get down.”


“Me? Why me?”


“You said you would leave your worries behind?”


I laughed out loud. Just seeing him play around like this meant that my father was in a really good mood right now.


“If you have worries, there will be progress, right? Okay, let’s go. Let’s go!”


When father said ‘let’s go’ again, the carriage started off.


I stuck my head out the window and said to Hui.


“I look forward to working with you in the future, Uncle Whee!”




Hui did not drive the carriage in a hurry. Perhaps Sima Ming asked him to do so.


I hope this exodus will be a journey, not a mission.


I leaned out the window and felt the wind blowing in.


“The weather is really nice!”


My father didn’t answer, but I could feel that he was excited too.


“How nice it would be if we could just get off the beaten path a little bit, Father. So even if it’s not this trip, let’s come out often in the future. Oh, there’s a beautiful lake over there on the hill. Have you been there? If you go in the winter, the lake freezes over and you can break the ice and go fishing, it’s the best fun.”


My father already had a look on his face that said his ears were sore, but it was going to continue. In order for our trip to be enjoyable, I had to do most of the talking.


“Oh, by the way, if you go over the mountain on the other side, there’s a tent that’s going to be a great place to eat noodles. Would you like to go check it out?”


Then an unexpected answer came from my father.


“I used to be good at making dumplings.”




I put my protruding head back into the carriage.


“Have you been there?”


“In the past.”


Yes, my father also had a time when he roamed around the martial arts world like me. Was it when he fought with Kwonma? Or when he was close with Hyeolcheon Doma and Ilhwa Geomjon?


“Why don’t you stop by sometime when you come back?”


My father nodded, as if he wanted to go there again.


“People’s mouths are really scary. They know so much about delicious food that even if you do business in such a remote place, people will come looking for you like ghosts because of the rumors.”


“Let’s go quietly.”


“yes!”


Father, don’t you know that? I lived as quietly as you. No, maybe I was even quieter. I’m saying all the things I couldn’t say in front of you.


The carriage that had been running for a long time stopped.


While Whiga let the horses rest, I took a walk around the neighborhood with my father.


“Before I left, Elder Thomas came to see me.”


“What did you say?”


“Don’t mess with your father.”


A faint smile appeared on my father’s lips.


“Thomas must have been very fond of you.”


Yes, how could my father not know? That the role of scolding me in the place where I was trying to persuade my father was ultimately for my own good.


“You like your father very much, Mr. Doma.”


It’s not something I said just to make you feel good. It’s true that Doma’s feelings for his father are very deep.




“Don’t mess with Thomas.”


Bloodthirsty Doma tells his father not to mess with him, and his father tells Bloodthirsty Doma not to mess with him. How could there not be something special between the two?


Then I wanted to joke around and say, “Who am I to tease?” but I couldn’t because they told me not to tease.


“Okay, I’ll always be careful.”


Just the fact that I was walking with my father and having this conversation made me feel good. Everything that happened from now on would be a first for both my father and me.


Since the words ‘leaving the church with my father’ come first, whatever I do will be my first time.


Then my father suddenly asked.


“Can you feel it?”


“A wolf?”


When I got it right away, my father looked at me with a surprised expression.


First of all, he answered even though I didn’t tell him where he felt it. He was surprised that he had already felt the sensation from about twenty meters away.


“In unfamiliar places, I now naturally emit energy and look around.”


There was a lot of energy stretching out like spider webs around my body.


“It’s thanks to what my father taught me.”


It was a skill on a whole other level than when I learned how to emit long, thin chi while hunting with my father.

“You weren’t just playing around.”


“Originally, martial arts training and love were done in places that were not visible.”


As his expression of bewilderment grew, so did his father’s smile.


After walking around like that, I returned to where the carriage was.


At that moment, from far away next to the carriage, Whiga waved his hand and shouted.


“The meal is ready.”


Hwi had already lit a campfire and finished preparing a meal.


“Doesn’t it seem like Mr. Whee is excited too?”


My father didn’t say no. He must have sensed that I was more excited than usual.


I hope my father sees many new sights.


That sight of Hui waving at us right now must be something you’re seeing for the first time.


The meal that Whiga prepared was something he had prepared and brought with him when he left.


“From now on, your meals will be poor.”


“It’s okay.”


I chimed in.


“Don’t worry, mister. You have a father. I can’t forget the taste of the food he cooked.”


The second time I went hunting with my father, he cooked the food himself.


The dish, which was stir-fried meat with vegetables and mushrooms, was surprisingly delicious. She also proved that she cooks regularly by boiling soup with it.


Now that I think about it, there are a lot of things about my father that I don’t know about. Like his flower-patterned pajamas, like the way he packed his bags for the trip yesterday, and like the way he cooks.


I hope to see another side of my father on this trip.




“I have prepared something too.”


I took the leather out of the leather pouch that was loaded onto the carriage.


First of all, a tiger skin for my father.


“Okay, please sit here.”


My father sat on it.


There were more things I had prepared. I handed one of them to Whee.


“This is Uncle Whee’s.”


Hui looked slightly surprised at the fact that he had prepared his own as well.


“I’m fine.”


“Please sit down, I have some too. Ours is a wolf skin.”


Whi and mine were the same leather.


As Hwi continued to decline, his father nodded while looking at him.


Then, without further hesitation, Hui sat down on the leather that I had prepared.


“Thank you, Master.”


“you’re welcome.”


I have felt something great throughout my past life.


That place is really important to people.


The will of the father.


This floor of the Pungryu Tavern is also available.


And that leather seat that Whiga is sitting on now.




Because we all live to get our own seats. We are the ones who start wars to get our seats.


If you say, “What’s important is the seat? Isn’t it the heart that’s important?” then it’s because you haven’t really felt the embarrassment and confusion of not having a seat when you go somewhere.


So, those who have not experienced it will never know how much relief and gratitude someone can feel when they are given a small chair.


I’ve never seen Whi’s place before. He’s always been in hiding. That’s why that wolf skin is more important.


As the three of them were sitting side by side eating, it suddenly started to rain.


Swaaaaaaah.


“Father, please go to the carriage first and let the rain… … .”


I was about to tell you to avoid it, but I stopped myself.


“Isn’t this just too inhumane?”


“What are you talking about?”


“If a person gets wet in the rain, he should get wet.”


An invisible curtain of energy was spreading around my father’s body, causing the rainwater to bounce off.


“No, and if you have this kind of talent, you shouldn’t let us get hit either.”


Of course, my father was not the type of person to expand his energy by saying such things.


Then my father held out his hand.


Then, the door to my father’s purse inside the carriage opened and something came out.


It flew out of the carriage and spread itself out over our heads. It was a windbreak used to protect against wind and rain.


The ropes attached to the cloth were tied to the carriage and the tree, and were fixed in place. Rather than moving in the air, the movements were fast and precise, as if a skilled person had tied them by hand.


I didn’t know my father would prepare something like this!


“Since ancient times, the best part of camping is watching rain! It’s the best scenery.”




As I spoke cheerfully, my father revived the campfire that was dying out in the rain with his warm words.


Whoosh whoosh.


“Awesome! Father!”


My father made a face like, “Well, this is about it.”


I would have spread it out whenever it rained during our trip, but actually, it was really good right now. It made our first day, our first meal, unforgettable.


After finishing the meal, I brought the tea that Hwi had prepared.


We watched the rain while drinking tea. My father sat in the middle, and Hwi and I sat on the left and right.


“Isn’t it hard for you to take care of your father?”


I thought he would be embarrassed if I asked him that question in front of his father.


“It’s hard.”


My father and I looked at each other at the honest answer.


Hui answered with a smile.


“I think I should answer the young cult leader like this.”


He has been listening to all my conversations with my father. He must have heard everything Sima Ming has reported about me. He knows me as well as my father.


“You really hit me hard. You should have said that it wasn’t hard so I could have turned the tables on my father.”


Then this time my father looked at me.


“If you say that it’s not difficult at all because your father is quiet, I was going to tell you this. I think there must be some parts that are difficult because you’re quiet. It would be easier if you just said everything like I did, but since you don’t say anything, shouldn’t you try to figure out what he means? That’s not easy for someone below you.”


I spoke to my father on behalf of Hwi. I didn’t know what kind of conversation the two of them had, but given their personalities, why would they share so many troubles with each other?


“In the end, you say everything you want to say.”


“I have to. If I don’t say anything, no one will know, right?”




At my words, my father looked straight ahead again.


Then, out of the blue, he asked Hwi.


“So was it hard?”


This time, Hwi was truly embarrassed and surprised. His father was not the type of person to ask such a question. Rather, he was the type of person who would not speak in such a situation.


“no.”


The conversation didn’t continue any longer. But just the fact that his father asked if he was having a hard time meant a lot to Hwi.


In the meantime, the rain stopped.


\* \* \*


We camped that night.


If I were to go to the guest house, I could do that, but my father accepted my suggestion to spend the first day quietly.


It felt really good to lie down next to my father and look at the falling stars.


He asked her to lie down with him and sleep with him, but she firmly refused, saying that she could not dare to sleep with Cheonma. Since each person has things they can and cannot accept, he did not force her any further.


“Father, I’m sorry.”


“why?”


“I should have asked my brother to come too, thinking of my father. I’m so selfish. It seems like I still want to monopolize my father.”


My father was silent for a moment.


“It’s okay.”


Those words lifted some of the weight off my heavy heart. Still, I can’t help but think of my brother whenever I’m alone with my father.


“father.”


“Why are you doing that?”


“I called you in case you were sleeping.”


“Then shouldn’t I not call you?”


I smiled and looked back at my father, who was lying next to me. He was looking up at the night sky with a blunt expression.


I engraved this scene in my mind.


My father looking up at the night sky, me watching him, and the stars in the sky.


That’s how our first night of the trip passed.


\* \* \*


The next day, we stopped in town.


While Hui was renting a stable to feed and rest the horses, my father and I went out to look around the market for a while.


We were walking together through a crowded place, but no one was particularly paying attention to us.


My father and I had both reached the state of perfect counterattack and my father wrapped an old cloth around my black magic sword, just like the ultimate heavenly sword wrapped around it, so that it would not be noticed.


“Is this your first time coming out to the market outside of Magachon?”


“I used to go there a lot when I was young.”


“You went out to fight the Kwon Ma, not to look around the market.”


My father nodded in agreement.


“I wish I was Master Kwon Ma back then.”


I answered my father’s questioning gaze.


“I want to see my father when he was young. I want to have a conversation with him.”


“!”


I mean it seriously. What would it look like? What would its personality be like? Would it be similar to me?


“Are you by any chance a talkative person like me?”


After a slight snort, my father said:


“I can drink like a drunkard, but I’m not sure I can talk as much as you do.”


“A chatterbox who beats a drunkard! That’s too much!”


I walked around the market with my father, chatting about this and that.


When people came in droves, we would stop. Even this experience would be new to my father. He probably never stopped walking because someone was coming.


How about looking at the scenery like this?


People walking around, laughing and chatting, soliciting customers, angry people. There were all kinds of people there.


Father looked at them silently. What was he thinking as he looked at them?


“Even with so many people, nothing happens? The commander-in-chief was worried that if my father were to leave the school, things would go wrong. The fate of the martial arts world would not leave my father alone. It started out as a small incident, but it grew bigger and spread into another incident.”


I looked at my father and said decisively.


“But that will never happen.”


It was just then.


A man approached us stealthily.


“Guys, let’s have a manly showdown.”


There were a few people gathered where he was pointing. Three overturned plates on a makeshift table.


Ah! A devil and a swindler! How could I miss this wonderful opportunity?


“My father is a one-of-a-kind gambler. What do you think? Could you please pay for dinner…?”


There was no need to provoke my father.


Before he could finish speaking, my father walked towards where the thieves were.


I smiled and asked the man who had solicited us.


“Is that guy’s hand fast? He must be really fast to be faster than my father’s eyes.”
