 Chapter 453 – Arrangement (6)


 I know you’re not someone who pursues goodness or values chivalry. However, if you have even the slightest thing you hold dear, it’s you who lives in the present world, not me who is merely a byproduct of the past, who can protect it from the coming destruction.


 Jin Woon-hwi had read the heavenly secrets long ago.


 And in those heavenly secrets, he realized that the only way to prevent the destruction brought about by absolute evil filled with madness was absolute demon, which could be considered even greater.


 He might not know about the former “him,” but the current him is different.


 If he understands human life and knows the value of loved ones, he would know that harmony and coexistence, not destruction, are the only answer.


 Meanwhile, Mok Gyeong-un stared at him silently.


 Then he finally opened his mouth.


 “Protect from destruction…”


 -That’s the answer to why I drew you here. For the sake of those dear to you…


 “I refuse.”


 -As expected, the right decisi… What?


 Jin Woon-hwi’s eyebrows raised beneath the mask.


 

 He had guessed this wouldn’t be an easy man to persuade, but he didn’t expect an outright refusal.


 At this, Jin Woon-hwi sighed and said,


 -If you don’t do it, the seeds of the Central Plains might dry up to the point where even saying “countless people” would be laughable. Are you saying you’ll just watch this happen?


 “I live only for revenge and to protect those close to me. If you want grand heroics, find someone else.”


 -……


 “Ah, right. You have a descendant too, don’t you? You made arrangements for her as well, so why do you need to draw me in? If it’s that urgent, use her.”


 -If that child could stop it alone, I would have done so long ago. Even without my arrangements, when that moment comes, many will move. What I hope is for you to play a crucial role in creating the trigger…


 “No. I have no intention of moving according to the scenario you’ve set up.”


 -……


 Faced with Mok Gyeong-un’s unyielding resolve, Jin Woon-hwi fell silent and looked at him.


 Indeed, because his essence was that of a demon, he wasn’t a vessel that could be easily moved.

 However, this kind of response was also somewhat expected.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c4f98310f240f4d43d687", id: "pf-8947-1"}) ‘Everyone wants to go against what’s called fate. I was the same.’


 Rather, seeing Mok Gyeong-un’s stubborn attitude reminded him of his own younger days.


 In those days, he too acted according to his own heart rather than for the greater good.


 Because of that, he experienced many things, being pushed and pulled in various directions.


 As if reading his mind as he momentarily indulged in memories of the past, the dagger beside him made a resonating sound as if chattering.


 -Woo woo woong!


 ‘Yes, you’re remembering the old days too, aren’t you, Sodam.’


 Jin Woon-hwi chuckled and then opened his mouth.


 -I understand. I respect your will as well.


 “You’re giving up easily.”


 -Rather than giving up, the affairs of the present world are, as you say, for you and those living in that era to handle. Come to think of it, I have no right to tell you what to do just because I’m worried about the future. However, remember that even if I don’t force you, there will come a time when this becomes your path.


 “……”


 In truth, Mok Gyeong-un was inevitably bound to clash with the Secret Society and the Mok Gan.


 It was for his and Cheong-ryeong’s revenge.


 From this perspective, as Jin Woon-hwi said, their paths might eventually converge.


 However, he didn’t want to be dragged along by someone else’s intentions rather than their own, and he didn’t want to attach grand, altruistic reasons like doing it for everyone’s sake.


 “If you’re done talking, let me out of here.”


 There was no reason to stay here any longer.


 Moreover, something had clearly exploded just before he was sucked into the bamboo slips.


 He needed to hurry back.


 Jin Woon-hwi shrugged and answered.


 -Letting you out isn’t difficult. But won’t you regret leaving?


 “What is there to regret?”


 -This is literally an arrangement. It seems you haven’t fully understood the Eight Thought-Shattering Techniques yet.


 “……”


 -Still, it’s impressive. Probably due to your innate essence, you’ve reached this level. For an average mind, it would be difficult to understand even after decades or centuries, but for you, it’s been only about ten years or so, right?


 “……”


 Ten years?


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c50524a5a770dd7e4e350", id: "pf-8948-1"}) It had taken only about half a year, one-tenth of that time.


 However, Mok Gyeong-un didn’t respond to this.


 Instead,


 “So what do you want me to do?”


 -The latter part of the Eight Thought-Shattering Techniques is different.


 “Different… how?”


 -As one reaches higher realms, martial arts converge into one, like all streams flowing into the sea. It’s like countless streams eventually reaching the ocean.


 “……”


 -“The Form of Harmony[1] and the Form of the Five Elements[2] can only be accepted once one realizes the balance of all flows and the greatness of nature. However, since this is directly connected to the Way of Immortals[3], it cannot be mastered through ordinary enlightenment alone.”


 “…So what are you trying to say?”


 -I’ll teach you some of the Way of Immortals so that you can fully master the Eight Thought-Shattering Techniques.


 “The Way of Immortals?”


 -Yes. If you were your original self, Heavenly Demon, you would have been demon itself and unable to learn the Way of Immortals, but now it’s different. Humans are beings with all possibilities. That’s why they’re like blank canvases, able to accept anything. You now have immeasurable value.


 “……”


 -Don’t be wary, I’m not teaching you expecting anything in return. Even if you don’t become a hero, if the calamity of destruction occurs, you’ll inevitably have to face it. That being is not human but a transcendent Imaemangyang. With your current power alone, you might fall into despair.


 “So you’re saying you’ll pass on the Way of Immortals and give me the remaining clues to the Eight Thought-Shattering Techniques?”


 -That’s right. I think it’s not a bad proposal for you either.


 Mok Gyeong-un stared at Jin Woon-hwi with narrowed eyes at this proposal.


 Then he shook his head.


 “I refuse.”


 -…You refuse?


 “Yes.”


 -Why, may I ask?


 “Whether it was your intention or chance, it’s certain that I’ve escaped many crises and reached a higher realm because I learned the Eight Thought-Shattering Techniques. I express my gratitude for that part.”


 -Tak!


 Mok Gyeong-un brought his hands together in a martial salute to Jin Woon-hwi.


 Jin Woon-hwi was puzzled by this unexpected expression of gratitude.


 However, Mok Gyeong-un, undeterred, lowered his hands and continued speaking.


window.pubfuturetag = window.pubfuturetag || [];window.pubfuturetag.push({unit: "663c509f310f240f4d43d83e", id: "pf-8949-1"}) “But I don’t want to rely on your help anymore, Jin Woon-hwi.”


 -You don’t want to rely on my help… Then are you saying you’ll overcome future difficulties with your own power?


 “Yes.”


 -Hmm.


 Jin Woon-hwi stroked his chin as if troubled by Mok Gyeong-un’s decision.


 Having read the heavenly secrets, he knew.


 The calamity that would soon befall would bring about the worst situation that even the current Mok Gyeong-un could not possibly prevent.


 At least, he might need to shed one more layer and reach the end of the natural order to be able to cope with the crisis.


 -If that’s your will, I can’t stop you, but to rise one level higher from your current state, you either need to understand the principles of harmony and the five elements through the Way of Immortals, or directly absorb five-element energy as pure as natural energy.


 “What is the Way of Immortals?”


 -The Way of Immortals is…


 “Isn’t it the way of becoming an immortal?”


 -It’s not that simple, but broadly speaking, that’s correct.


 “Then my path is not the Way of Immortals.”


 -…Then what is your path? If you desire a higher realm, you’ll have to walk a stable path.


 “I realized while fighting with you, Jin Woon-hwi.”


 -You realized? What do you mean?


 “That I don’t need too many things.”


 -You don’t need many things?


 “I haven’t been practicing martial arts for long, but I’ve learned that knowing many things doesn’t necessarily mean becoming stronger.”


 ‘!?’


 “A sharp sword that can cut anything and supreme power. I need nothing else besides these.”


 ‘!!!!!’


 Jin Woon-hwi’s eyes, visible through the gaps of the demon mask, gleamed at Mok Gyeong-un’s conclusion.


 How could he arrive at such a thought?


 It’s quite surprising.


 He himself had encountered numerous connections and through them gained enlightenment to reach higher realms.


 That’s why he believed everything was learning and harmony.


 But Mok Gyeong-un was different.


 Through this encounter, instead of accepting the arrangement and following the same path as him, he was choosing to walk a completely different, independent path.


 -Supreme power… How can you reach that without understanding the principles of the five elements?


 “Harmony is not my path. Infinite power is like the supreme. In the end, what matters is will.”


 -……


 Jin Woon-hwi was genuinely impressed by Mok Gyeong-un.


 At that level of attainment, one would feel that the path ahead is daunting because they’ve climbed so high, and the wall would feel like despair and wailing.


 That’s why he tried to guide the way through his arrangement, but there was no need for that now.


 This person truly didn’t need a master.


 A being who creates his own path.


 A true great master.


 \*\*\*


 At the same time.


 More than half of the bamboo trees that formed the bamboo forest through the formation technique were broken and shattered, and the interior was almost completely devastated.


 Six Offices Commander So Ye-rin, no, Jin Ye-rin, was breathing heavily, covered in wounds.


 “Haa… Haa…”


 -Pareureu!


 Her hand holding the sword was trembling violently.


 Beside her was a middle-aged man with a sunken forehead, Ghost Blade, who was in even worse condition than her.


 Not only had one of his arms been cut off, but his left shin seemed to be broken as he staggered.


 Moreover, he was bleeding heavily, apparently having been pierced through the abdomen.


 “Kuleuk kuleuk…”


 “Is this all you’ve got?”


 A man with a fierce expression was looking at them as if they were pathetic.


 There was a third eye on the man’s forehead, and Jin Ye-rin’s complexion was not good as she looked at it.


 ‘…He’s strong. Too strong.’


 They had faced the man with the third eye together, but far from being evenly matched, they were actually being pushed back.


 Jin Ye-rin bit her lip hard at this strength that even two peerless masters who had surpassed the wall of walls couldn’t handle.


 -Kkwak!


 ‘If this continues, Cheol Su-ryeon’s sacrifice will have been in vain.’


 The earlier situation flashed through Jin Ye-rin’s mind.


 The being with the third eye suddenly appeared in the interior of the formation technique made of green meadow.


 He was not the main body of the Secret Society’s leader, the Mok Gan, but an avatar.


 However, the avatar was not just one.


 ‘!?’


 Surprisingly, there were two avatars.


 They had different faces and age ranges, but the atmosphere and pressure they exuded were identical.


 [Where is he?]


 [He should be here.]


 The first target the avatars sought was Mok Gyeong-un.


 Though she didn’t know why they were looking for him, realizing it had something to do with the bamboo slips, she hid them in her bosom.


 Then she fought against the two avatars of Mok Gan who exuded such an overwhelming aura.


 She fought together with Cheol Su-ryeon, but she was shocked.


 The two avatars of Mok Gan were truly monsters.


 Even a peerless master like Cheol Su-ryeon was helplessly pushed back by their combined attack.


 Then, when Jin Ye-rin was caught by one of them and her life was in danger, she managed to escape thanks to Wicked Granny Cheol Su-ryeon’s quick thinking.


 [Let her go. Then I’ll tell you about the forbidden technique.]


 [Don’t think of deceiving me. I too am a master of techniques. Any clumsy trick will result in cutting off the last bloodline of the Jin family.]


 [Cheol Su-ryeon, I’m fine, absolutely don’t…]


 -Kkwak!


 [Keok!]


 [Didn’t I say I would talk! Take your hands off her immediately!]


 [Speak. Then I’ll keep my promise.]


 In the end, Wicked Granny Cheol Su-ryeon spilled the method of the forbidden technique.


 As she seemed to be properly revealing the technique, one of the avatars released his hand from her neck.


 Then,


 -Young miss.


 Wicked Granny Cheol Su-ryeon sent her a sound transmission, urging her not to move at all.


 She wondered why, but then,


 -Kung! Kung!


 Cheol Su-ryeon struck the ground repeatedly with her staff that had a ring attached.


 Then, as space tore open, Jin Ye-rin’s body was sucked into it.


 [I-Cheol Su-ryeon!]


 [This woman!]


 As one of the avatars hurriedly tried to grab her as she was being sucked in, Cheol Su-ryeon launched her body to interfere with him.


 Then she said goodbye to her with a bright smile.


 -Please survive.


 Along with this, through the tiny gap of the closing torn space, she could see Cheol Su-ryeon throwing her ringed staff towards the pillar in the center of the thatched house.


 -Kwaaaang!


 And with a thunderous sound, the bamboo trees forming the formation technique all broke at once.


 Thanks to Cheol Su-ryeon’s sacrifice, she thought she had escaped the crisis, but she had to face another despair as soon as she came out.


 That was because there was one more avatar of Mok Gan.


 The third avatar had cut off Ghost Blade’s right arm and was gripping his neck, seemingly interrogating him about something.


 She attacked to save him, and then they fought together, but this was the result.


 

  Despite their combined attack, it was rather they who were injured.


 “Haa… Haa…”


 The strength in her hand holding the sword was gradually fading.


 Having consumed eight-tenths of her innate true energy, it would become dangerous if she continued to fight.


 -Jeobeok jeobeok!


 Jin Ye-rin barely swallowed dry saliva as she watched Mok Gan’s avatar approaching.


 Even though it’s not the main body, it’s this strong, and Mok Gyeong-un not only faced such a monstrous avatar but even killed it?


 What on earth should I do?


 As she was watching the approaching avatar of Mok Gan in despair,


 -Pareureu!


 The bamboo slips in her bosom suddenly began to tremble.


 ‘!?’
