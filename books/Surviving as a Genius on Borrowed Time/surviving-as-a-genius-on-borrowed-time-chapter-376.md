Jeong Yeon-shin’s speech was monotonous.


It wasn’t just the ups and downs in his tone. His facial expression didn’t change as he spoke. Even his mouth moved minimally.


Because I’m sincere.


“The main force of the Shingeomdan. The great leader under the short leader… … .”


The sad expression on the 10-year-old’s face faded. He frowned slightly and spoke as if he was talking to himself.


“There was no one in their right mind among those who wore black clothes and had the character ‘Prince’ tattooed on them, but you have gone too far.”


“That’s the traitor’s perspective.”


“… … .”


Meanwhile, some of the crowd surrounding the two people repeated Jeong Yeon-shin’s words verbatim.


The word ‘Mihu’ was repeatedly heard from the mouths of masters who had mastered the path of sensation and had keen hearing.




Hearing this story, some of the common people exclaimed in admiration. That Confucius truly despises Sima Weidao.


“I said I wanted to see the martial arts, but I didn’t say that it would fit the unwritten rules of martial arts.”


Jeong Yeon-shin added while touching Yeo-roe’s sword.


“Even if you go down, the rain will continue.”


A statement that breaks the conventions of the martial arts world. Jeong Yeon-shin did not take it seriously.


Isn’t it strange that a government official would follow the customs of the black clans?


It’s the same even if the opponent is a god of thirteen thousand.


Even if each individual was so strong that they could compete with the elders of the old faction, in the end, they were worse than the gangsters who had their names written on the military register and were dragged off as soldiers. That was what Jeong Yeon-shin thought.


“her.”


Suddenly, the corners of the mouth of the expert in the ten-year profession went up.




“Monkey, it’s okay because I’m a monkey… … ?”


He stopped mumbling to himself and gestured back.


Kugu palace!


The ground shook with repeated, brief vibrations. It was in the midst of the disciples standing behind the Ten Commandments.


They planted a dozen large wooden crates in the ground and retreated a distance, their movements being as orderly as a herbivore’s.


“I wonder. If the Aesongi of Iphwangseong has accumulated enemy feats comparable to Gongwolmu.”


A mysterious wave rose from the body of the ten-year-old man who had turned his back on the chests.


The moment Jeong Yeon-shin suddenly felt a wave of energy that seemed to be on the border between the Eogum and Heogongseop, all the wooden boxes behind the Ten-Way Sword burst apart.


Kwajik!


Weapons that rise into the air, piercing through wooden debris.




It was the 18-barreled weapon used on the northern front.


A staff with a large hook instead of a handle is called a goeja (拐子), a wolgeuk (鉞克) with an axe blade attached underneath the changgeuk (拐子), a gujeolpyeon (鉞克) that is split into nine sections and makes a loud noise, a bangcheonhwageuk (鉞天花園) with a crescent moon-shaped blade attached to each side of the spear blade, a shield with a swirling pattern, etc.


A divine energy flowed from the surface of all the short and long weapons. They floated around, reflecting the sunlight brilliantly.


The master of the thirteenth heaven took it out. Even the magic weapon cannot help but contain spirituality.


Woohoooooooo―


The new recruits lined up behind the 10 specialists.


The retired tax expert’s rough eyes flash.


The temperament of a great general who was used to fighting in the field. Now, he was an absolute being who stood tall in the martial arts world that was developing and becoming stronger as time passed.


“Let’s compare them.”


The noisy crowd became quiet. The air on the hill and even at the foot of the mountain seemed tense.


Ssang―!


When the ten-man swordsman draws his sword from his waist, he reaches back with his other hand and grabs the handle of the silver-plated sword.


Jeong Yeon-shin was already holding the scroll.


The ten-member master let out an exclamation of “Wow” when he saw the sword being removed from its scabbard as naturally as a current of water, but Jeong Yeon-shin, who was feeling tense, did not even move her eyes.


He recognized his opponent as a powerful spirit.


‘Jecheon Daeseong… … .’


The water level is hot.


It’s not just because of the previously casted Igi-eogeom. It’s because the martial arts of the ten-professional warriors who lead the new soldiers are radiating spirituality.


Just like Jeongyeonshin’s Seonryongihwagyeol, it seems that there is a secret technique that deals with the upper level of the ten thousand mixed yuan skills in the ten thousand mixed yuan skills of the ten thousand masters.


The high waves were wafting the weapons, ready to be drawn and withdrawn at any time.




Ten Commandments of the King of Heavenly Soldiers and the King of Ten Thousand Soldiers.


He cultivated the true energy of Manjonghonwon-gong to the utmost and practiced the new martial art called ‘Jeungcheonmu (曾踐武)’.


A being that launched a fatal counterattack even when being ambushed by the Blood Flame Cult Leader.


‘Go.’


Jeongyeon Shin took a step.


Even in broad daylight, there was no sunset, and it seemed as if a purple light was flickering on his heel. Not in some hidden dragon formation, but in the middle of the world that was constantly turning.


Jeongyeon Shin’s new form has become blurred.


thud!


The next moment, he was standing in front of the Ten Commandments, his long legs planted on the ground. His clothes, pitch-black as the night sky, fluttered in the faint shards of white light.


The distance was shortened to ten miles by light aircraft.


There was a huge recoil in my waist and legs, but it only lasted for a moment.


He twisted his vital energy and muscles at the famous point on his lumbar spine and pushed all of that strength into his right hand. At the same time, there was a natural movement of the blade like an electric current.


Geomryeoseomneungsik, Simgeukgirin.


He picked up the thunderbolt and struck it down.


Oh my god!

There was a loud explosion. A translucent shockwave ripped through the ground, and as it did, heat flowed out from the armor of the ten-man warrior who had belatedly extended his sword to block the attack.


It was because the aerodynamics were suddenly raised. If the Samhwachwijeong had not reached its peak, it would have been impossible to even react to it.


“This is amazing… … .”


The cold sweat on the forehead of the ten-year-old expert dissipates into a puff of smoke.


Jeong Yeon-shin, who was facing him with his sword, glanced at Yeo-roe’s sword body that was slightly covering his face. It was wrapped in a nine-sectioned iron whip.


It’s a phrase book.


Earlier, the ten-pronged swordsman stretched out at the same time as he threw down his sword.


I saw the sight of the sword being sealed before the power of the Shimgeukgirin reached its peak.


There is also an image of a small snake wrapping its sword around itself and suppressing the sword strike.


It was my first time eating like that. It was very painful.


“It’s no longer usable.”


With just one blow, the ten-pronged swordsman clicked his tongue and let go of the piece. The gold lacquer on the handle was completely peeled off.


At the same time, a small axe was sucked into his hand, without releasing the sword he was holding with his other hand.


This time it’s the axe method.


Swish!


He came at Jeongyeonshin’s side at an incredibly fast speed.


The first thing that came was a faint, gray glow from the axe, followed by a sound. The power felt was immense.


The mastery of herbivore chains is at its peak.


There seemed to be no set course. It seemed like there was a secret plan that it was enough to just kill the opponent.


Jeongyeonshin spread out her left hand and placed it against the bastard’s abdomen.




‘I’ve put on a protective gear.’


I felt a strong flow like a waterfall. It was an invisible wall of inner energy. I had faith.


Jeongyeonshin didn’t care. As soon as she thought of the Hwan-gang’s knot, a spiral current of air surged from her palm.


The operation of Jin-gi that brought about a compressed typhoon. The dam that had been imprisoning his qualities had collapsed due to the transformation of Hwan-gol-tal-tae and Sam-hwa-chwi-jeong. It was manifested at the same time as the thought.


Kwaaaaaaaang―!


An ear-piercing roar.


A dull vibration spread across the wide hill. The ground that had supported their feet sank in a large circle, and the torn bushes and sandy soil gushed out like a waterfall.


A single figure bounced violently through the dust.


It was a ten-pronged approach.


“A martial art more suited to killing people than the martial arts in the text… …!”


He waved both hands with a look of astonishment. Instead of the swords and axes scattered in the distance, a sword and a shield flew in and landed in the hands of the Ten-Tailor.


“Your mouth is alive.”


Jeong Yeon-shin swung her sword once and swept away the fragments.


The constant barrage of weapons that the opponent uses is annoying.


Although it was not as free-spirited as Eogum, it was clearly floating in the air following the ideology of the Ten Specialists.


Even when the ring burst just now, they scattered in all directions and did not break apart. If you try to target them one by one, it would be like giving your back to the Ten Commandments.


A peerless master of the 18-and-a-half-arms.


The method of blocking the return was surprising. Perhaps because he thought it was too late, he placed an internal energy barrier around the axe face that he had placed on the long-range wave.


Then, he used Hwagyeong’s technique to release his strength and relax his body. As if he were a famous Taekwondo master.


It was impressive to see him surrender to the waves that were difficult to resist.




A master who is well-versed in all the principles. This is the reason why he was able to act as the ruler of Sacheon even after being absorbed by the Blood Flame Cult Leader.


‘You showed me so much.’


Jeong Yeon-shin was secretly impressed.


A person who can draw out ten percent of the utility of herbivory in any situation.


The skill was profound.


Time has passed. To the point where the words of Geumsimunju suddenly come to mind.


-Yours is just a trick.


A story she told in passing after witnessing Jeongyeonshin’s Mancheonhwawoo.


―Mancheonhwawoo is a supernatural technique that allows the masters of the Tang sect to spread out their poison and secret techniques that they have practiced throughout their lives like the Milky Way. It is a martial art of the ages. It would be hard to understand a technique that can easily accomplish anything.


It has a big impact. Even before the Ten Commandments are revealed,


Unlike the King of Guimyeong, who acted as the sole king in the Jiaolong formation, the Thirteen Heavenly Lords constantly clash with the world and hone their martial arts skills.


Jeongyeonshin absentmindedly opened her lips.


“I will live my whole life with the attitude of practicing closed-door meditation.”


Those born with a sense of insignificance leave traces of life in the form of a gongwolmoo. Naturally, it will require great patience.


It was different from Jeong Yeon-shin, who belatedly paid attention to the story that other unmanned people had separate training times.


“Because your body is dull, you must have felt the storms of the world greatly.”


“hmm?”


“Mr. Moonju is amazing. He must have worked hard to make a living.”


Jeong Yeon-shin said.


The ten-year-old monk, who had been staring at him blankly for a moment, burst into laughter.




“I’ve heard all sorts of curses in my many battles, but I’ve never seen a brat use such outrageous provocations. I wonder if it will work on the Northern Warriors.”


“Provocation…?”


“Take up your sword so that you won’t regret it. Your herbivores were all amazing, but looking back, I see that you won’t be able to handle my sternness.”


“Are you talking about Gongwolmu?”


The ten-year-old scholar raised the corners of his lips without saying a word and answered. Something very worth seeing is coming. It was a time when Jeong Yeon-shin felt somewhat excited.


The ten experts opened their mouths.


“Open.”


The voice echoed like an echo. It had a dreamy quality and a spirituality that released the listener’s mind.


It is a prerequisite for new skills.


It was said that martial arts that had reached a worldly level were difficult to distinguish from sorcery.


As the ten-man warrior trudged towards Jeong Yeon-shin, his eighteen-armed weapons scattered in a large circle.


It was a shape surrounding two people. The atmosphere was split dreary.


Saaaaa―


The flying staffs, the bangcheonhwageuk, the large axe, the moon geuk, the hooks, and the long staff began to rotate in a large circle like a magic circle and close the gap.


“There was nothing particularly special about it for me.”


The ten-man expert smiled sadly and said.


“Since I have mastered all the arts to a level where I can kill people, there is no reason to look for something grandiose and use it as a life-saving tool.”


“Enough?”


Even when Jeong Yeon-shin tilted her head to the side, Sip Jeon-mun-ju didn’t lose her smile. It was a smile that was full of life from the beginning.


“so…….”




He took a step.


“I decided to show off all eighteen skills at once. It was a trick from my younger days.”


Doo-woong


It was a sound that rang out when he took his foot off. It was like beating a drum in a deep cave. At the same time, the ten-story bell stopped.


Then another ten-character swordsman broke out of the same spot and took another step. The new form looked somewhat blurry.


“knife.”


He spoke and stood in place. As he reached out, the sword that Jeongyeonshin had deflected flew towards him and he caught it.


“do.”


Another one of the ten masters took a step forward. As he said, a large sword was sucked into his hand.


The same scene continued. The sight of the 18-army weapons being called out one by one and being split into pieces. It was a miracle. There was no other clone technique like that of Jecheon Daeseong.


Amidst the crowd bustling as if they were paying their respects to the Jade Emperor, a faint sense of joy appeared in Jeong Yeon-shin’s eyes.


Finally, we have arrived. Into the realm of true purple.


[It is a transposition.]


The eleven masters of the Ten Commandments spoke at the same time, slowly moving in a circular formation.


An overwhelming sight that seemed to escape reality. It was different from the Lee Hyeong-hwanwi who was known to the world for his quick renewing technique.


The skill of the peerless master, transformed into Gongwolmu, was literally transcendent.


[And this is… … .]


Another ten-man warrior was about to take his foot off the gas. Jeong Yeon-shin grabbed the last weapon before him.


Beneath my feet, the ten-mile wide waves of the ship were shimmering like starlight.


“Axe (axe).”


He said.
