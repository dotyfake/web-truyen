# Absolute Regression Chapter 452 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Ju Hyang-wol, cảm thấy nhẹ nhõm lạ thường khi nhờ Geommugeuk, người mới gặp, giúp mình tháo gỡ thỏa thuận. Hwang In can ngăn cô đưa thỏa thuận cho người ngoài xem, viện dẫn "thông lệ hợp đồng" (contractual convention) là phải xem trước. Geommugeuk phản bác, cho rằng phía Hwang In mới là người phá lệ. Anh tự giới thiệu mình là "con hiếu thảo nhờ mẹ vợ".

Hwang In giải thích việc không gửi trước thỏa thuận là do tin tưởng những nhượng bộ lớn trong đó sẽ làm hài lòng đối phương khi xem trực tiếp. Geommugeuk đọc kỹ thỏa thuận, nhưng lại nói "Tôi không nghĩ có điều gì như vậy cả" khiến Ju Hyang-wol thất vọng.

Khi Hwang In yêu cầu ký kết, Geum Woo-jin bất ngờ chỉ ra các điều khoản bất lợi cho Ju Hyang-wol, những điều khoản mà cô cho rằng có lợi cho mình. Ông nhấn mạnh rằng nếu thế lực của Ju Hyang-wol không mạnh hơn đối phương, những điều khoản này sẽ trở thành "những điều khoản độc hại" (poisonous clauses). Geum Woo-jin kết luận: "Có lý do để một thương nhân từ bỏ lợi nhuận của mình."

Ju Hyang-wol nhận ra sai lầm của mình. Geommugeuk khen ngợi cha mình đã "giả vờ không thấy, nhưng đã thấy mọi thứ". Ju Hyang-wol định xé bỏ thỏa thuận, nhưng Geommugeuk ngăn lại, bảo rằng đó là bằng chứng cho thấy đối phương "cố nuốt chửng" gia tộc Zhou. Anh khuyên cô nên giữ nó ở nơi an toàn nhất.

Khi Ju Hyang-wol định cất thỏa thuận vào người, Geommugeuk lại ngăn cản, vì điều đó chẳng khác nào thừa nhận đối phương mạnh hơn. Anh gợi ý cô nên giao nó cho người mà cô tin tưởng nhất, nhưng Ju Hyang-wol nói người đó đã qua đời, ám chỉ người cha quá cố.

Bất ngờ, Geum Woo-jin đề nghị: "Tôi sẽ lo việc này." Ju Hyang-wol cảm thấy hình ảnh người cha mình hiện lên trong Geum Woo-jin và trao thỏa thuận cho ông. Geommugeuk nói thêm rằng thỏa thuận giờ đây "được cất giữ ở nơi an toàn nhất trong thế giới võ thuật này".

Hwang In, nhận ra mình đã đánh giá thấp đối thủ, vội vã rời đi nhưng bị Geommugeuk chặn lại yêu cầu trả tiền trọ. Sau khi Hwang In thanh toán, Ju Hyang-wol vẫn còn bàng hoàng. Geum Woo-jin gọi thêm món và Geommugeuk trấn an cô.

[Previous Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-451/)[Next Chapter](https://faqwiki.xyz/absolute-regression-chapter-453/)452  

That’s impossible.




Because I went to a person I met for the first time today and asked him to help me with such an important task.


If my mother or the swordsmen heard this story, they would say, “Are you crazy?” They would think it was an accident, not a mistake.


‘But why do I feel so relieved?’


When I asked him to find a reason to tear it apart, my whole body felt tingly and good. It was as if my instincts were screaming, “You did a great job.” It was my first time experiencing something like this.


Moreover, the opponent’s response was in keeping with this madness.


“How many do you want me to find?”


How can you be so confident without even seeing the agreement?


It didn’t matter whether these words were boasting or confidence, because the relief she had felt earlier came back to her heart.


“The more the better.”


The moment she was about to hand over the agreement she was holding to Geommugeuk.




At this point, Hwang In, who had been watching the scene, stepped forward.


“Your Majesty, that won’t do.”


At Hwang In’s calm restraint, Ju Hyang-wol’s hand stopped in midair.


“Your Majesty, you may not be familiar with this kind of agreement, but you must not show this agreement to outsiders.”


Hwang In was certain that Geommu-geuk was an outsider. When he had investigated the Ju family’s Geomga in advance, there was no one who gave off this kind of special feeling. Also, judging from what Ju Xiang Yue had said to them and her attitude, she was definitely not an insider.


Then Geommugeuk asked Juhyangwol.


“Did you promise in advance that you wouldn’t show it to outsiders?”


“No, I just saw the agreement for the first time today.”


Hwang In intervened again and said:


“This is a contractual convention.”




The sword dance also treated him calmly.


“I don’t understand why someone who knows the rules so well would make such a mistake.”


“What do you mean?”


“Isn’t it customary to send this agreement in advance so that we can review it thoroughly before meeting? I think you’re the one who broke the convention.”


Hwang In couldn’t refute those words.


Joo Hyang-wol only just realized this fact. She had never experienced anything like this before.


“So, let’s leave out the word ‘custom’ from this meeting today. It never existed from the beginning.”


Hwang In realized that the young opponent in front of him was not as easy as he looked.


“Who are you?”


“I became a filial son thanks to my mother-in-law.”




Hwang In couldn’t understand what those words meant. Just from listening to them, he couldn’t tell if they were on the same side as Ju Hyang-wol or if they had really just met at the entrance to the inn.


In any case, it was clear that they were peculiar people. Even while having this tense conversation, Geum Woo-jin and Hwi continued eating.


Even while having natural conversations like, ‘Try this too.’ and ‘Thank you.’


“If you read the agreement, you will see that the top has made many concessions. That is why I neglected to send the agreement in advance. I thought you would be satisfied if you saw it in person. Read it. Then you will understand what I mean.”


There was definitely this confidence in Hwang In’s eyes.


‘Is there anything you can find if you read it?’


Geommu-geuk accepted the agreement in Joo Hyang-wol’s hand.


“Let’s read it.”


Geommugeuk put it down on the table and began to read it slowly.


Meanwhile, Geumwoojin and Hwi continued to eat. They didn’t even care about this. At first glance, it seemed like they were angry at their son, but judging from their expressions and atmosphere, they didn’t seem angry at all.


With the eyes of Juhyangwol and Hwangin focused on them.


The sword dance drama read the entire agreement, which was several pages long, all the way to the last page.


“Why are there so many difficult words?”


“That’s because there are different words used in the agreement. So? Did you find the part of the agreement that needs to be torn up?”


After a moment, Geommugeuk answered.


“I don’t think there is such a thing.”


A look of disappointment crossed Juhyangwol’s face. It seemed like this person would be able to find an answer.


On the contrary, a satisfied smile appeared on Hwang In’s face.


“Okay, now that you’ve confirmed it, please sign.”


Now that they have taken the bold step of showing the agreement to outsiders, it has become more difficult to postpone signing.




‘I wonder if Mother’s choice was right this time?’


She greeted the swordsman politely.


“Thank you for reading.”


The moment she picked up the agreement on the table!


An unexpected person broke the silence.


“Chapter 1, line 6.”


Surprisingly, the person who spoke was Geum Woo-jin.


Joo Hyang-wol quickly read the clause that Geom Woo-jin had mentioned.


It was a clause that if something happened that damaged each other’s reputation, they had to agree to compensate each other with money.


“Is there a problem with this?”


Joo Hyang-wol asked cautiously.


If the Inspector General and the Chief Justice reach an agreement, who will benefit? So I thought this clause would actually be advantageous to the Chief Inspector General. Did I mention another clause incorrectly?


Instead of answering, Geum Woo-jin pointed somewhere else again.


“Chapter two, line nine. Chapter three, number two, item seven.”


Joo Hyang-wol read all the parts that Geom Woo-jin had mentioned. It wasn’t difficult content, and it was content that they thought was advantageous. Parts that they thought the other side had made concessions in order to join hands this time.

For example, there was this clause: If it is revealed that the other party is clearly at fault, it is permitted to use force beyond monetary compensation.


It was their maximum concession, as Hwang In said, that it was okay to attack the upper part of the sword.


‘Why are you only pointing out the parts where they gave in?’


She looked at Geum Woo-jin with a puzzled mind.


Geum Woo-jin, who had been staring at her quietly, suddenly asked.


“Are you sure you are stronger?”


“!”


At that moment, Joo Hyang-wol’s heart sank.


This was something I had never doubted for a moment while reading the agreement, or since entering this guest house. Of course, I thought that the swordsman was stronger.


What if not? What if we are not strong?


All of these provisions will become poisonous clauses and will come back to bite you later.


We were so distracted by the vague and difficult to understand parts of the agreement that we missed the simplest, yet most important, part.


The most dangerous traps are not the ones that are hidden. They are in plain sight, but when no one thinks they are traps, their power is incomparably stronger.


The last words of Geum Woo-jin that clear up all these doubts at once.


“There is a reason why a merchant gives up his profits.”


Joo Hyang-wol thought that what Geom Woo-jin said was right.


‘That’s what I was missing.’


The emotions that surged at the same time were the comfort and relief I had felt earlier.


Earlier, I thought that the feeling of relief might not have been because of the younger son, but because of the father.


Geommugeuk said with a bright smile.




“You pretended not to see, but you saw everything?”


“Didn’t you put it on the table and read it so I could look at it too?”


“I am quick-witted because I take after my father. Ah! I should have inherited my father’s brilliant mind, too.”


“You must have noticed, right?”


Geom Woo-jin thought that Geom Moo-geuk had the same thoughts. He must have noticed that he was sneaking a peek. However, Geom Moo-geuk denied it until the end.


“In the eyes of parents, their children are the smartest.”


Joo Hyang-wol felt that whenever she looked at the two of them, she would become more and more absorbed in them. It was still the same even now.


It wasn’t the time to be blankly staring at them like this, but I was looking at the conversation the two were having with envy.


She looked at the yellow man.


As expected from a merchant’s blood relative, he was good at controlling his emotions.


“I think you’ve misunderstood. We’re just a small group of merchants. If we were that strong, why would we want to join hands with the Zhou Sword Family?”


Then Joo Hyang-wol asked him.


“You tell me. Why?”


What if they had a stronger force than the sword? What if they hid that fact and put forth this agreement? This was not simple cooperation, but a conspiracy.


The yellow man was still calm.


“You misunderstand.”


“I guess so.”


Joo Hyang-wol heard the agreement and tried to tear it up in front of her.


At that moment, Geommugeuk stopped her.


“Would it be refreshing to tear that up?”




Joo Hyang-wol turned her head towards Geommu-geuk.


“It’s best to keep it without tearing it. What you’re holding is evidence.”


“Evidence?”


“Isn’t this proof that they tried to swallow the sword? It might feel good to tear it up, but the real pleasure will be felt by that person.”


“!”


The moon was dizzy.


At first, I brought it to Geommugeuk and asked him to find a reason to tear it up.


So I thought I finally figured out the reason. So I was going to tear it apart excitedly. But that wasn’t the case. I had just narrowly avoided the danger of falling into a trap.


And the traps continued to be discovered.


“Yes, I will keep it safe.”


As she tried to put the agreement in her bosom, Geommu-geuk stepped in again.


“You can’t put it there.”


“Why?”


“Weren’t you trying to tear up that agreement because you acknowledged that the other side was stronger?”


“that’s right.”


Otherwise, there would be no problem with this agreement.


“How can they come out if you have evidence against them?”


When Juhyangwol looked at him with a look of incredulity, Hwang In spoke calmly.


“I tell you again, we are just merchants.”


Zhu Xiangwol could now look at him objectively. That mere merchant was too calm.




She asked the swordsman.


“Then what should I do?”


“You must keep it in a safe place. Leave it in the safest place you can think of.”


Joo Hyang-wol was lost in thought for a moment.


“Ever since I was little, there was someone I felt was the safest.”


“Leave it to him to keep.”


“That can’t be. He’s already passed away.”


The place where she felt safest was in her father’s arms.


It was something she didn’t have to say, but for some reason she wanted to say it. Was it because she was under so much psychological pressure today? Or was it because she wanted to say it to these two people who had strangely fascinated her? She couldn’t understand her feelings.


She tried to muster up her courage. After all, this was her business and her family’s business.


“I’ll take care of it. Thank you so much for your help.”


It was the moment when she finished speaking.


Once again, an unexpected situation unfolded.


Geum Woo-jin extended his hand towards her and said this.


“I’ll take care of it.”


The moment she heard those words, Joo Hyang-wol’s heart ached.


The image of his father overlapped with the image of Geum Woo-jin reaching out his hand.


Geum Woo-jin was looking at him bluntly, but his father, who was overlapping him, was smiling.


“I found the content that needed to be torn up, so I should take responsibility for it.”


The sword dance drama knows that this is not the case.




Since her father has been influenced by her lately, she can help her out for a bit. Yes, she can find the contents of the agreement for her to feel good about.


But you’re telling me you’ll take care of this?


Who knows when or how their work will end? In a situation where there is work to be done in Shaanxi? This is absolutely unbecoming of a father.


If so, the conclusion is one.


The upper part of the zodiac is connected to the work we have to do in Shaanxi.


The person who knew about this mission was my father, who had heard about it from Sima Ming. I deliberately did not ask. I would know when I got there anyway, and I wanted to focus solely on the trip with my father.


When all the demons gathered, Sima Junshi said this.


―To move this level of experts and organization, a huge amount of money would be needed. After secretly investigating, we found a clue that will help us track down the guys behind it.


Since you said you traced the source of funds, you will have to deal with people with great wealth in Shaanxi. It seems that the Imperial Clan is either a subordinate organization or has some kind of connection to them.


“It’s okay, so give it to me.”


Joo Hyang-wol, who had been hesitating, gave the agreement to Geum Woo-jin with trembling hands as if possessed by something.


Hwang In, who was watching the scene, felt his heart sink.


When I came here, I never imagined that I would experience something like this.


Hwang In’s gaze turned towards Geommu Geuk.


‘I don’t know who you are, but you messed with the wrong person.’


He probably thought of himself as a mere merchant. But if he had known what kind of place the Imperial Palace was, he would not have dared to come forward so fearlessly.


“I’m busy, so I’ll take my leave now for today.”


The sword dance did not just let him turn around.


“Oh, by the way, don’t just leave. Pay for the entire inn before you leave.”


Geommugeuk added with a smile as he looked back at him with a slightly stiff face.


“If you are a merchant, shouldn’t you do your math correctly?”


Soon, Hwang In answered with a calm smile.


“Of course. I am a person who is certain about give and take.”


He called the innkeeper, paid the bill, and left.


When Hwang In left, Joo Hyang-wol felt as if a storm had passed.


What if I hadn’t gotten up from my seat? What if I had signed right then and there?


How would your fate have been different?


“If what you say is true, they might come to steal that agreement.”


Out of concern for her, Geum Woo-jin called the owner and ordered a new dish.


“Since we’re already seated, let’s eat and then go.”


Joo Hyang-wol experienced a situation she had not anticipated until the end. She had not expected that she would end up eating with these people.


Instead of Geom Woo-jin, the person who reassured her was Geom Mu-geuk.


“You don’t have to worry. The thing you left in my care is now… … .”


Geommugeuk looked at his father with gentle eyes.


“Because it was kept in the safest place in this martial arts world.”
