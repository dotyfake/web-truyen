# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 21 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Jeongyeon Shin (cậu) được giao nhiệm vụ mới sau sự kiện Huyết Viêm Giáo (Blood Flame Cult): điều tra vụ mất tích viên đá Jasodan của phái Hoa Sơn (Hwasan). Cậu sẽ đi cùng phái Hoa Sơn để tìm kiếm nó, đồng thời giám sát họ. Jeongyeon Shin chấp nhận vì muốn tích lũy kinh nghiệm chiến đấu thực tế và tránh mặt ông nội.

Cậu cùng Heonwonchang và hai thành viên khác lên đường đến Tây An (Seoan), lãnh địa của phái Chung Nam (Jongnam). Tại một khách điếm lớn, họ gặp gỡ các đạo sĩ của Hoa Sơn, dẫn đầu bởi Cheonju Jinin (Cheonju Jinin) với khí thế mạnh mẽ. Margin giới thiệu các thành viên của mình, và Cheonju Jinin nhận ra Ma Gwang-ik (Magwangikju), Ilryeongeommae, Cheonganmaggeom (Blue-Eye Demon Sword). Cheonganmaggeom Cheongmyeong (Thanh Minh) có biệt danh "Ma Kiếm" khiến Jeongyeon Shin ngạc nhiên.

Cheonju Jinin đề nghị một cuộc giao đấu giữa đệ tử của họ để "giao lưu". Ông ta chọn một đạo sĩ trẻ tên Yu-Hyeon (Yu-Hyeon), được ca ngợi là "Ngọa Long của Hoa Sơn" (sleeping dragon of the volcano). Margin đồng ý, và Jeongyeon Shin sẵn sàng giao chiến. Các thành viên khác của Ma Gwang-ik tỏ ra lạ lẫm khi cậu được gọi là "đệ tử của Hoàng đế", vốn chỉ là một danh xưng không chính thức.

Jeongyeon Shin và Yu-Hyeon bước vào giao đấu trước sự chứng kiến của đám đông. Yu-Hyeon mở đầu bằng kỹ thuật "Ám Hương Phiêu" (Hwasanpa Amhyangpyo) của Hoa Sơn, nhưng cậu đỡ đòn bằng "Xoắn ốc" (Spiral), chiêu thức đầu tiên trong Thập Họa Vô Cực Quyền (Shihwamugeukwon), khiến Yu-Hyeon bối rối. Tiếp đó, Jeongyeon Shin tấn công bằng một chiêu thức mạnh mẽ, hất tung đất đá. Yu-Hyeon chống đỡ bằng "Lạc Anh Chưởng" (Hwasanpa Nakyeongjang). Jeongyeon Shin nhận thấy đây có thể là nguồn cảm hứng cho chương thứ ba của Thập Họa Vô Cực Quyền. Cậu đề nghị kéo dài trận đấu thêm một chút, khiến Yu-Hyeon kinh ngạc.

“···I think I mentioned this when I was handing over the Blood Flame Cult incident. I said that the Hwasan faction lost Jasodan.”


“The Seomseo branch said they didn’t have the capacity to do that. Thanks to that, I was able to get my hands on the Blood Sword.”


“That’s right. It hasn’t been resolved yet. Jasodan is a treasure worth its weight in gold. It’s a magical elixir, a treasure of the martial arts world. Those who were suspected, the sects who took the lead in questioning them in order to look good to Hwasan, and even the other sects and warriors who wanted to repay the favor at this moment. All the sects of Shaanxi Province were involved.”


“······There will be a proliferation of unmanned vehicles.”


It wasn’t a serious face. The vast island martial arts world, bigger than any small country, was completely involved. I couldn’t help but feel excited.


I realized it already. Those who claim to rule the world with a sword are scattered all over Shaanxi Province.


They are all martial artists who will refine the Shihwamugeukkwon.


Was it because his feelings were showing on his face? The margin he proposed couldn’t hide his hesitation.


“I will accompany the Volcano faction. I will search for the Volcano’s Jasodan until the fighting is over.”


“A warrior from another sect helps in finding the spirit of the Japha······?”




“It also serves as a kind of surveillance. The Hwasan knows about it. There was already a big fight with the Sapha group, and one of the largest guest houses in Xi’an collapsed. The casualties were enormous. Ma Gwang-ik’s role is to restrain the Hwasan faction, which is at the center of the storm, from using force.”


“Will the volcano accept it?”


“The Hwasanpa wants to become the second Shaolin Temple. As a representative of the Taoist sect, they want the imperial recognition. Even if you go alone, you will be treated well. Of course, there will be restraints.”


“······.”


Jeongyeon Shin was silent for a moment and then slowly opened her mouth.


“There probably won’t be a conflict this big in the world of martial arts. Now that the justification has been established, it’s time to swing your sword as you wish in actual combat.”


“Yes. Given your nature, I believe you will be able to achieve unparalleled accomplishments through training. This is an opportunity to freely share swords with all kinds of renowned martial artists in the name of the Emperor’s Realm.”


I already agreed to it in my heart. Martial arts without actual combat experience are no different from theory.


Shihwamugeukwon is a newly created martial art, so it lacks basic skills, but it seems like it can be supplemented in this mission.


There won’t be many opportunities to learn the martial arts of the old school.




“You’ve already done one mission well. This time, it’s discretion.”


“I will go.”


I didn’t think much about it. I just thought that I should stay a little bit away from the Iphwangma.


Because I didn’t know how my crazy grandfather would persuade me.


The moment you give and receive something as blood relatives, you are definitely tied together. There were times when you were held back when you had to move forward.


‘I need to go out as much as possible without taking a break to accumulate achievements.’


Jeong Yeon-shin, whose resolve had been strengthened, raised her head.


“How many people are there?”


“It’s the same as the Blood Flame Cult. Heonwonchang is a new member, and Cheongmyeong and Baekmirye are still receiving punishments for their actions at Juru’s Changcheondae. They are very active in supporting me. I’ll go with them.”


“Your Majesty?”




“If the old school is your opponent, then the new sword sect leader is the right choice.”


“When do you leave?”


“Now that the arrangements are complete, we plan to leave tomorrow. Pack your bags as soon as you get back.”


Jeongyeon Shin slowly nodded. It seemed like she would have to learn the master’s martial arts skills after she returned.


Now was the time to master the Shihwamu Geukwon. The experience from this mission would be of great help.


\* \* \*


The sunlight casts a pink glow on a few plum blossoms that are falling brightly.


The wind that blew in cursive script, as if it were written by a famous calligrapher, caressed the five warriors of Ma Gwang-ik along with the flower petals and passed by.


‘I hope the next mission is somewhere with a back road.’


Jeongyeonshin thought. The time that had passed was a waste.


The reason why the plum blossoms lined up in full bloom felt oppressive, unlike before, was because time just didn’t seem to stop.


“It’s a shame. Isn’t this the center of Shaanxi martial arts? I can’t wear the martial arts uniform of Ihwangseong.”


Heonwonchang grumbled.


Instead of the conspicuous imperial uniforms, they wore plain clothes. This was to save face for the Hwasan faction.


“It doesn’t seem to be as bustling as Yangyang is now.”


Jeong Yeon-shin said. He was used to hearing Heon Won-chang’s pointless stories.


Just looking at the way he smiled as if to say, “When did you ever complain?”


“They say that the Seomsan area is a large city where all kinds of masters interact. Excluding Hwasan and Jongnam.”


“okay.”


Jeong Yeon-shin, who responded calmly, looked around. It was definitely different.




It had a much more organized charm than Yangyang, where the streets were filled with all sorts of merchants, including large merchants.


It seemed to be because it was a city that had flourished for a very long time since before the founding of the country.


The group got off in front of a huge inn that was said to have a two hundred year tradition.


In appearance, it was almost like a base.


They never stayed in shabby places when they passed through the city. That was the wealth of Ip Hwang-seong.


Margin got off the horse and opened his mouth.


“Seoan is the territory of the Jongnam faction. It is not a place where Hwasan can stir things up at will. We must also be careful.”


“Uh······. I didn’t know before I entered the main castle. I would become closer to words than swords.”


Heonwonchang patted his waist and thighs.


That was when.


Suddenly, the door to the guest house opened. At the same time, Jeong Yeon-shin felt a strong energy gathering.


“The masters of Ip Hwang Seong have arrived. I’ve been waiting for you.”


There were male and female Taoist priests lined up in unison.


There were more than a dozen people, but it wasn’t crowded.


The approaching people felt like one giant sword.

The most striking feature was the plum blossom embroidery on the hem of everyone’s white uniform.


‘Volcano Wave!’


The young swordsman in the lead had a sharp impression and a fearsome aura. It was a feeling comparable to when I first encountered Margin.


“Cheonju Jinin (Cheonju Jinin). You must have been here for a long time. The journey was rough, so we were barely able to make it.”


The margin was short.


Jeong Yeon-shin felt Heon Won-chang flinching next to her.


Should I commend him for not opening his mouth and making a fuss?


‘The leader of the plum blossom inspectors.’


He was called the Hwasan Sword Master. He was a famous swordsman.


The name did not remain in Shaanxi Province alone.


The extremely powerful master leading the elite swordsmen of the Hwasan faction has personally descended the mountain.


“Magwangikju, Ilryeongeommae, Cheonganmaggeom (Blue-Eye Demon Sword). I know all these faces.”


Cheonju looked at the three people with an expressionless face.


‘Demon sword?’


Cheong-an-mageom Cheong-myeong. It was the first time I heard of that nickname. It was very unexpected. How did he fight the enemy?


When I look back at Cheongmyeong, it just smiles.


In Jinpyeong-hyeon, I only saw a light sword fight with the Blood Flame Cultists. I couldn’t help but be curious.


“I don’t think there’s any need for an introduction. The sword we shared earlier will suffice.”


The clash between Ma Gwang-ik and the plum blossom inspectors was an incredibly famous incident.


I heard that not a single person of the Iphwangseong faction came forward, so I wonder what the Hwasan faction was like.




“I can see how the Iphwangseong side feels about this. Even if he is Ma Gwang-ik, he brings his disciples along.”


The sharp gaze of the Heavenly Master seemed to pierce through Jeongyeonshin, but he passed it by indifferently.


I have just come to see the Lord of the Iphwangseong and the Lord of the Jeon-dae Shingumdan.


Even if the volcanic swordsman is a great master, he cannot compare to them.


‘hmm?’


Jeong Yeon-shin suddenly saw a swordsman of the same age among the Hwasanpa masters.


He had a languid expression. He even yawned slightly as if everything in the world was trivial.


The boy Taoist priest smiled brightly when their eyes met and looked up at the sky.


Margin, who had been quiet for a moment, soon opened his mouth.


“that······.”


“The disciple of the Emperor over there seems to be no ordinary one. How about having him interact with the disciple of our Jangmunin through swordsmanship? Even if we acknowledge each other, it would be uncomfortable for us to travel together, so it would be a small entertainment.”


God turned his eyes to Margin and said.


‘You’re trying to break my spirit.’


The Volcano Wave also said that they knew that this accompaniment was a form of surveillance.


It is one of the best swordsmen in the world. Even if it was permitted because of the royal family, it is impossible for them not to feel uncomfortable.


Since it is ambiguous to share swords among the main masters in a situation where they will be together, they plan to determine superiority through the future of the sect.


“Disciple of the Emperor?”


It was Heonwonchang who suddenly became absent-minded.


Practitioners of the Iphwangseong who failed to become White Warriors.


When Jeong Yeon-shin competed with the blue masters of Changcheon-dae, the children of Ma Gwang-ik who came to watch said so.




It is not an official status. This is because the priestly relationship within the nature is not recognized.


He trained from a young age and before he could wear the white robe, he was only called a disciple of the Emperor of Heaven out of courtesy.


While the faces of the parties involved did not change, the expressions of the four remaining Ma Gwang-ik members became strange.


‘Unless you’re an absolute master of purple, it seems like it’d be hard to read someone’s skills with just prayer. It could be because my amount of true energy is relatively small. The energy wave would be weak.’


Jeong Yeon-shin, who had gained a little enlightenment, said.


“lender.”


“hmm?”


As Margin turned around, he flicked the sword of the Ip-Hwang-Geom hanging on his waist. It was a sign that he was going to step forward.


“Your Majesty, you’re causing trouble again… Would five seconds be okay?”


The young Taoist priest who was looking up at the sky asked in a languid voice. It was not a small voice either.


Is it okay to be this rude?


For someone who was a disciple of the leader of the Hwasan faction, he seemed to have no thoughts at all.


“There is something to learn. Go at it with all your might.”


“What do you want me to learn? I heard that Ma Gwang-ik and Ma Gwang-gyeol are martial arts of senses.”


The boy sighed and walked out. At the same time, the area in front of the guest house suddenly became a stage.


It is said that fights in the martial arts world often break out like this out of nowhere.


‘That’s interesting.’


Jeong Yeon-shin thought of the Jongnam faction masters who inspired her to achieve quick swordsmanship in Jeonggajang.


At that time, I had no idea about Jongnam’s martial arts. How deep is the Hwasanpa’s martial arts knowledge?


Ma Gwang-ik and the masters of the Hwasan faction stood in a wide circle.




Xi’an is not a small city.


Passersby who had been wandering around wondering what was going on began to turn into onlookers, making a fuss. People whispered about the Hwasan faction from all directions.


“But what happened?”


“Keep your voice down. Volcanic pile!”


“The swordsmen of the volcano have come to our West Coast?”


“I guess he’s about to do some magic. It’s truly a precious sight. Just look at that extraordinary young Taoist. His energy is divine.”


“It seems that the martial artists are teaching each other. As expected from the Taoist monk Hwasan. He really is very generous!”


Jeong Yeon-shin smiled inwardly. It was refreshing to see the ceremony held among the common people.


It was the first time since the first imperial examination that the quick sword was tested.


The two people stood facing each other. Jeong Yeon-shin slowly opened her mouth.


“I was talking about the five-second point.”


“Are you offended? I’m sorry. I didn’t mean to look down on you. I had a hard time practicing this morning.”


The boy Taoist smiled faintly.


“It’s the flow of the Volcano faction.”


“Jeong Yeon-shin.”


He answered briefly. It was because he couldn’t bring up Ma Gwang-ik while wearing plain clothes.


I heard from many places that I was being taught and that I was being rude.


Some people were very surprised by the name Yu-Hyeon and even shouted. There were also people from the Seoan martial arts world.


“The sleeping dragon of the volcano!”


“They say that the disciple of the Hwasanpa Jangmun Jinin is a peerless genius. I never thought I’d see him in person like this!”




“I heard rumors that he mastered the Falling Hero Palm Technique and the Six Combinations of the Divine Sword. When I saw it in person, it was indeed true to its reputation. It was harder than I thought.”


“They said that he was the future of the next generation’s volcano. There was even talk that he had already entered the realm of the Purple Haze God’s power.”


The formula was gorgeous. Jeongyeonshin’s smile deepened. There was no need to talk at length.


When two warriors face each other, they only talk about martial arts.


It was the moment he was about to take a step forward. Yu-Hyeon’s body grew larger without a sound.


He came rushing in with a technique that resembled the footwork of a famous person. It seemed to be the Hwasanpa Amhyangpyo (暗香飄) that I had only heard of.


Wow!


The hand that had been raised along with the forward movement was brought down. The open palm stretched out like a flower pattern.


The martial arts of the old school that I saw in person were so mysterious and splendid that they seemed like sorcery.


‘Is it a falling dragon method? It’s not a frill, it’s a change. So that the herb cannot be destroyed.’


My mind is filled with interest. If I break them one by one, won’t I get the same transformation?


Thud!


I deflected it with the back of my fist. The tension from the moment of impact was light.


Jeong Yeon-shin’s career continued to expand without losing momentum, to the point where it spiraled into a whirlwind.


The first one in Shihwamugeukwon was ‘Spiral’.


Kwaaaaa-!


“Huh?!”


Perhaps he didn’t know how to react. Yu-Hyeon’s face, filled with embarrassment, turned around. It was like that just from the slight touch of the waves.


“what······!”


It is strange to see him be so shocked as if he was being subjected to a power beyond common sense.


If he had as much power as Yu Hyeon, he would have just broken his neck with one blow.


Ugh.


This time, it was her turn to move forward. Jeongyeonshin followed Yoohyun, who hesitated and stepped forward.


The regime that had been thrust from behind the waist was like a steel arrow leaving the protest.


Jaycho, the sound of Jinbyeok’s feet brought thunder from his fist.


Boom!


The ground was turned upside down by the flying fragments of power. The sun’s halo in the middle of the sky was blurred by the dust.


Jeongyeonshin’s eyes stared straight ahead.


Yuhyeon, covered in dust, was seen relieving the effects of her career with dazzling sleight of hand.


It was the same as the first method shown. The Hwasanpa Nakyeongjang method.


It seemed like it would be enough to be the inspiration for the third chapter of Shihwamugeukkwon.


Jeongyeon Shin opened her mouth with a happy smile.


“A little longer. I’d like to do it for about ten seconds.”


“······!”
