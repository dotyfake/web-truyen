# Surviving as a Genius on Borrowed Time Chapter 8 - faqwiki.xyz

## Tóm tắt chương truyện

Jeong Yeon-shin bước vào trận đấu thứ hai của vòng loại Ip Hwang Seong (Ip Hwang Seong). Đối thủ của cậu là Namgung Hwasin (Namgung Hwasin) của gia tộc Namgung, một người có tài năng xuất chúng được đồn đại khắp nơi. Các cao thủ của Ip Hwang Seong cũng đánh giá cao Namgung Hwasin.

Hai người chào hỏi nhau, Namgung Hwasin rút kiếm. Đường kiếm của hắn đẹp mắt và sắc bén. Jeong Yeon-shin không rút kiếm mà tập trung nội lực. Ngay khi trọng tài ra hiệu bắt đầu, Namgung Hwasin tấn công chớp nhoáng khiến kiếm của Jeong Yeon-shin gãy làm đôi. Mọi người kinh ngạc, các cao thủ Ip Hwang Seong trở nên im lặng và tập trung theo dõi.

Bất ngờ thay, Namgung Hwasin tuyên bố thua cuộc. Hắn giải thích rằng mình đã chậm trễ trong việc giải phóng chân khí vào kiếm. Các cao thủ Ip Hwang Seong bàn tán xôn xao về Jeong Yeon-shin, thậm chí có người còn muốn chiêu mộ cậu.

Sau trận đấu, Jeong Yeon-shin được thông báo là đã qua vòng loại và được yêu cầu đến một hoa viên khác. Trên đường đi, cậu suy ngẫm về trận đấu vừa rồi và nhận ra rằng kiếm của mình là một vấn đề. Cậu cần ăn Trái Cây Cheonhamok (Cheonhamok fruit) để cải thiện.

Trong lúc đó, cậu nhận ra vấn đề của mình là không biết cách truyền chân khí vào kiếm. Cậu bắt đầu thử nghiệm và nhanh chóng lĩnh hội được cách thức, cảm nhận được sự kết nối giữa bản thân và thanh kiếm. Thanh kiếm rung lên như đang khóc, và Jeong Yeon-shin đạt đến cảnh giới "nhân kiếm hợp nhất".

Namgung Hwasin đến chúc mừng cậu và tiết lộ rằng cậu đã bảo vệ Jeong Yeon-shin trong lúc cậu lĩnh hội. Hắn cũng chúc mừng Jeong Yeon-shin vì đã có được biệt danh "Jeong Công Tử".

Sau đó, Jeong Yeon-shin gặp lại Heonwonchang, người cũng đã vượt qua vòng loại. Cả hai được thông báo về vòng kiểm tra cuối cùng: một cuộc phỏng vấn với Lãnh Chúa của Thành (Lord of the Castle), một nhân vật huyền thoại.

Khi đến lượt Jeong Yeon-shin, cậu bước vào một căn phòng kỳ lạ đầy cây cối. Ở đó, cậu gặp Lãnh Chúa của Thành, một người có vẻ đẹp phi thường và đôi mắt sâu thẳm chứa đựng mọi nguyên lý của thế giới. Vị Lãnh Chúa này nhìn Jeong Yeon-shin và nói: "Ngươi... là huyết mạch của đứa trẻ đó."

The problem was when the unconscious opponent was dragged out and the second and final fight began.


‘There are many monsters in the world.’


Jeongyeonshin thought. It felt like he had encountered a person who would one day become an absolute master like the Sword Master.


A man in pure white walking towards me from the other side.


The slender jawline is as graceful as the blade of a sword, and the sharp, black eyes, as if reflecting will, show the appearance of a swordsman.


Her skin, as flawless as her pure white clothes, combined with her high nose bridge to reveal her nobility.


A truly peerless young man. He must have been about twenty years old.


‘Baekgirin Namgung Hwasin.’


I could tell without even asking. There couldn’t be another person like that in this place.


Even the masters of Ip Hwang Seong, who were sitting in a wide circle, showed interest.




“I wonder where they’ll take it. The big shareholders will be fighting over it.”


“He seems stronger than us? As expected, he’s Namgung.”


“Are you going to experience the Blue Sky Boundless Sword today?”


Passing was considered a given. Those waiting in the flower shop across the street made pitiful expressions as they looked at Jeong Yeon-shin.


‘He looks about five years older than me. I don’t think he’ll be a mountain I can’t climb someday.’


I can feel the energy that Namgung Hwasin is emitting.


The flow of energy is incredibly well-polished.


It had been several years since he had formed the Great Circulation and spread his internal energy to every vein in his body. It seemed as if he had even taken an elixir, and he was breathing with truly powerful energy.


The admiration of the masters of Ip Hwang Seong never ceased.


“It is never easy for a single rumor to pass through several provinces.”




“It is indeed a well-deserved reputation.”


Jeong Yeon-shin also admitted it.


‘Only my body is better. The rest is still to come.’


Namgung Hwasin came five steps forward.


I could feel the dignity of a prestigious family that was difficult to approach in the polite lottery.


“I am Namgung Hwasin of the Namgung family. I mainly trained in the martial arts of Changgung Muae Sword and Muhanbo. Please take good care of me.”


“I practiced my Jeonggadong skills at Jeonggajang in Hanam.”


Jeong Yeon-shin put her hands together and greeted politely.


Namgung Hwasin responded to his greeting by slightly bowing and then drew his sword.


The sword’s light rises frostily into the cool morning air with a clear sword name.




It was blinding.


The swordsman’s level can be measured by his or her swordsmanship and slashing, but Namgung Hwasin’s silver sword that was cutting through the air diagonally was beautiful.


Jeongyeonshin did not draw her sword.


The key to the recent popularity of the sword was its unexpectedness.


The key is to strike with a single sword while breathing hard enough to be guessed.


If it works well, it could pierce the weakness of that dragon-like review index.


I circulated the energy inside my body while standing.


“Get started.”


The judge who stood up alone among the unmanned people of Ip Hwang Seong and gave the evaluation spoke.


at the same time.


Oh my god!


Before she knew it, one side of Jeongyeonshin’s sword, which had been stretching out her arm to the side, was torn in two and flown away.


He slowly lowered his arm, still holding his sword, which was now cut in half.


A commotion broke out like wildfire in both gardens.


“What happened······?”


“What? What was it?”


“Is the boy real?”


“Baekgirin. What a fearsome sword!”


While the prospective participants were either confused or showed various confident reactions.


“······.”




The masters of Ip Hwang Seong were as quiet as mice.


Those who seemed arrogant, unlike the warriors of Gangho Jeilse. At this moment, they had a stern aura all over their bodies.


All the masters did not say anything and kept their eyes on Jeong Yeon-shin. They only looked at Jeong Yeon-shin.


Baek Gi-rin Namgung Hwa-shin said as he lowered his sword.


“I lost.”


Declaration of defeat. The unmanned personnel of Ip Hwang Seong opened their mouths one by one, as if it was obvious.


“Jeongyeonshin? What a truly terrifying swordsman.”


“I heard that Namgung Hwasin just passed the terms and conditions.”


“The boy looks at least five years younger.”


“There was a sleeping dragon in Hanam. I’m even more scared of that child’s age.”


“It seems like you haven’t learned how to load your sword with true energy. Should I teach you?”


Everyone’s attention was focused on the unmanned unit that had spoken the last words.


“Extermination Squad. Don’t act rashly. Is there a place that wouldn’t covet a guy like that?”


“Do not give orders. It would be better for you to come to the island of destruction than to rot away in the Wings of the Demon Light.”


“stop.”

The examiner said.


Jeong Yeon-shin felt surprised when she saw the quiet inside the room.


I thought that the ones who took on the dirty work would be the ones at the bottom of the hierarchy, but that wasn’t the case.


The responsible work is done by the superiors? I thought I knew the nature of the emperor.


“Namgung Hwasin, prepare for the next battle. And you. You said you were the Shinya Jeongyeonshin.”


“yes.”


“There’s another flower garden over there, to the north. Wait.”


“All right.”


Jeongyeonshin turned her head and waved the lottery at Namgung Hwashin.


“I hope we can get together next time.”


“······That’s what I wanted to say. Let’s meet again.”


Namgung Hwasin laughed.


His expression was very strange, and far from being dark, there seemed to be only interest and amusement on his lips.


‘My brother is being compared to the authors.’


He was of a different character from the Jeong siblings.


The moment the sword fight began, Jeong Yeon-shin struck Namgung Hwa-shin’s sword with extreme quickness.


It was because they realized that a long-term war had no chance of winning.


However, Namgung Hwasin seemed to be trying his best against the boy as he had stored his true energy in his sword.


That’s how Jeongyeonshin’s sword broke.


It could be said that it was his mistake to blindly use his sword, but Namgung Hwa-shin ended up admitting defeat.




He seemed to think he had lost since the release was so late.


‘Life in the Imperial City is much better than when I was in the Jeongga Market.’


Jeong Yeon-shin, who had collected the broken sword, walked north and thought.


\* \* \*


A flower garden where those who have passed the entrance exam gather.


I received surprised looks from those who were already seated.


Jeongyeonshin ignored him and recalled her sword.


The center of gravity of both feet, the overlap of the true energy of the Shigeukkyung, and the explosion of the contracted muscles. As of now, there seemed to be no way to go further.


As expected, the sword was the problem.


‘Did you say you were affiliated with Ma Gwang-ik? That unmanned man is right.’


During the bloody battle of Jeonggajang, the swords did not clash directly.


The ronin I encountered on the way from Shinya to Yangyang were not at a level where I had to worry about Jin-gi.


The entrance is different.


He has now set foot in the center of the martial arts world.


‘Cheonhamok fruit.’


I have to eat. I can’t just die like this.


‘You never learned how to put your true energy into a sword?’


It was natural.


Jeong Ga-jang was just a third-rate gangster who acted like a martial arts master in Shinya-hyeon.


I have never seen anyone among the political class who doesn’t like to talk.




If there was someone in the family who knew how to use such a skill, he couldn’t have been unaware of it.


‘Now that you know, that’s enough.’


It was enough for me to hear that there was such a thing. The moment I knew about it, I knew how.


The energy flows from the hand holding the sword to the half-broken sword. It doesn’t end here.


At the same time, I realized that my internal energy could flow freely through the iron that formed the sword body, and with this new sensation, my true energy enveloped the sword body.


Are you just putting energy into the sword? No.


Furthermore, I learned that I could become one with the sword through the energy of truth.


The consciousness that was absorbed in a single sword naturally progressed.


The sword was calling him. With a sense of a higher level.


Woof.


The sword vibrated. It sounded like it was crying on its own.


“Sword sound!”


The unmanned personnel in the flower garden suddenly stood up. Jeong Yeon-shin had her eyes closed.


He enjoyed the feeling of the sword crying in his hand, not caring about the commotion around him.


‘This is the unification of the body and sword. It literally feels like I’ve become one with my body.’


The swordsmanship that unfolds in this state will be new. What kind of power will the quick swordsmanship that has come to life with precision have?


As soon as I passed the entrance exam, I was just trying to get whatever I could.


The fruit of the world tree is still far away, but the current achievement is sufficiently satisfying.


‘Iphwangseong. It’s a really nice place.’


When I opened my eyes, I saw Namgung Hwasin smiling brightly.




My eyes were drawn to the sight of him raising his hand to the sword.


It was as if someone was watching over him from a close distance, lest he be disturbed by his enlightenment. He was standing guard over him.


“Congratulations on your achievement.”


He bowed slightly to Jeongyeonshin. It was as if one could not be so upright.


“I didn’t know you were the one who protected the law. Thank you. And······”


“······?”


“Congratulations on passing the Namgung Sohyeop entrance exam.”


Namgung Hwasin, who had a blank expression for the first time, soon laughed loudly.


There were those who looked at her as if they were envious of her friendship with Baek Gi-rin, but Jeong Yeon-shin’s gaze soon lingered on the sword again.


\* \* \*


After waiting for half an hour (one hour), I was finally able to see Heonwonchang’s face.


He said he took the test several times and passed it too.


It was quite funny to see him tapping the dragon pattern on his forehead.


“I’ve already decided on a nickname. How about ‘Entering the Wild God’?”


“A mysterious knight of the Imperial Palace? Do you sometimes choose your own nickname?”


“Isn’t it possible? The world of martial arts is a world of shameless people who introduce themselves by their own nicknames. If I introduce myself as Iphwangshinhyeop, then that will become my nickname.”


“Then wouldn’t all the swordsmen in the world already be divine swordsmen and sword stars?”


Heonwonchang pretended not to hear. Jeongyeonshin just chuckled.


‘Nickname.’


A name given by martial artists when one displays great inaction or is involved in an incident that attracts attention.




Unless one is a villain, most nicknames are a source of identity and great honor.


Like the Dan-ae Sword, the Muryeong Kwon, and the Baekgirin.


“It seems that there are already people who call him Jeong Gongja.”


It was Namgung Hwasin.


“Is that you? I just took the test.”


“Shining Art. If the people of Iphwangseong personally call it that, then it is already a nickname of the martial arts world.”


“The talent of light? It’s just that the young one’s sword is a bit fast, so don’t you think it’s just a trick?”


Namgung Hwasin smiled, revealing his pure white teeth.


“A bit fast, huh? If you say so, what will happen to the person who lost his breath? Also, there are many cases where the potential of a person without a name is changed into a nickname. Congratulations.”


“······thank you.”


Jeongyeon Shin answered with a slightly trembling face.


Seomye Jeongyeonshin. It’s a name I never imagined coming to mind when I was sitting at the market and doing my homework.


He looked at the Iphwang Shinhyeop next to him as if he was envious.


“Everyone gather together!”


He was an examiner at the training ground.


“Now, if you pass just one more gate, you will be a warrior of the Imperial Castle. I will tell those who pass in advance that you will learn and practice in the castle that was built alone in this world, and you will carry out your duties and share your food and accommodations with them. Maintain your proper dignity and become a warrior befitting your position.”


The reaction of the twenty people who had undergone the initiation ceremony was quiet.


Jeongyeonshin could guess the reason.


It was a happy thing to pass the second test, but the final hurdle was the interview with the Lord of the Castle.


A living history of the Ming Empire, he is a peerless martial artist who is often cited as the best in the world.


Meeting a mythical figure alone was not an easy task for Jeong Yeon-shin either.


As we passed the magnificent pavilions under the guidance of the judges, no one opened their mouths.


“······.”


It was the same even when I entered the main castle, which was of overwhelming size and located in the center of the vast Ip Hwang Seong Fortress.


They were called up one by one and came down with faces that looked like they had lost their souls.


They said it was an interview, but the duration was very short, so it felt like they were just looking at my face and then coming down.


Finally, it was Jeong Yeon-shin’s turn to go up.


It felt like there was an endless spiral of stairs going upward.


‘I told you to go all the way.’


After walking for at least a hundred steps, I reached the top.


There was an old, large door that opened by itself as I approached it.


The spacious office was truly bizarre. It was full of trees, branches, and bushes.


Giant tree trunks twist and rise naturally, forming what appear to be desks, tables, and beds.


A completely alive giant tree. The sunlight was shining through the large hole in the wall.


“My name is Jeong Yeon-shin.”


He said without wavering.


There was a being whose uniform was a light green color, as if it had been made of leaves.


She slowly raised her head, leaning against the tree, her face slightly hidden by the leafy branches.


Our eyes met. Something beyond thrill rose to the top of my head.


It was a feeling that even I couldn’t explain. It might be a sense of wonder and excitement at the fact that there was such a person in the world.


‘The best Emperor of Heaven.’


Her beauty, rare in the human world, and her pointed ears like the tip of a divine sword, are not her essence.


The deep green eyes were overwhelming. As I met their gazes, I felt like my soul was being sucked into me.


Eyes that seem to contain all the principles of the world.


I had a strong feeling that even the Sword Master, who was the absolute ruler in my memories, would not be able to escape those eyes.


A being of another dimension, so strangely that it takes a long time to interview him.


Saaaa-


A gust of wind blows, slightly lifting her long green hair and brushing Jeongyeonshin’s cheek.


The Emperor tilted his head to the side.


“You······are that child’s bloodline.”


She said.
