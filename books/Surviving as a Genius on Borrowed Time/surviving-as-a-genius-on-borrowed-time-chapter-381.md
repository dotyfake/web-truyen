\* \* \*


Raindrops are pouring down densely.


It was right after a thunderous roar rang out from Unhoebong Peak where the leaders of the Great Wave and Magwangikju had gathered.


Saaaaa―


Two men wearing wide-brimmed hats on their heads were hiding in the bushes.


It was a place with lush green leaves above and a clear view of the village at the foot of the mountain ahead.


These people are so calm that they can see straight ahead even though rainwater is dripping down their faces.


I had the endlessly rising Unhoebong peak behind me.


“There’s chaos. The situation is dire both above and below the peak.”


A middle-aged man with a sword spoke. His dry voice was immediately swallowed by the raindrops. It was the perfect place to have a secret conversation without wasting energy on things like transmission.




“I wanted to see the top first.”


The young man next to me smiles brightly.


The small brush and book he was holding were not wet by the rain because they were Buddhist treasures that contained a small amount of spirituality.


“Isn’t the true nature of the Tang Ma Gwang-ik-ju the talk of the town these days among the Dochalwon (都察院), or rather, among those who are well-versed in state affairs? There are many rumors that Comrade Do-dok-dong recognized his sharp personality and quickly took action, but on the other hand, there are also rumors that he is a butcher who treats even the local officials like pigs and dogs… .”


“He is the blood of the previous Shingeomdan leader. To that extent, he must be a gentleman.”


“Well… Anyway, I didn’t know I would be reporting on the black color of the Yellow Emperor here. My hands are itching to write about someone of such high status… If there are no accidents at Unhoebong, I will come down soon, right?”


The young man spoke, twirling the brush between his fingers. The middle-aged man, who had been responding indifferently, shook his head.


“Don’t forget how Eunuch Myeong-yeo fell from power. It’s forbidden to make hasty judgments.”


“Well… I don’t intend to put my own opinion into the text. Since the opponent is the grandson of a traitor, I have to protect myself.”


“It is the duty of the royal inspector to report what you see. If you want to live long in the imperial palace, you must see the truth and tell only the truth. Even this is a privilege we enjoy… Ma Gwang-ik-ju is a person who is considered a potential candidate for the position of the royal inspector. Now, personnel matters themselves are important matters for the country, so if you get involved in something wrong, no matter how good your family is, you may be mercilessly dragged to the execution ground.”




“Hey, do you really have to lose your head? Even the eunuch Myeong Yeo-ran was only demoted to the position of station master… … .”


“It’s too easy. It’s a different story.”


“yes?”


“Purple is not a mere person. He is a decisive battlefield that is recognized by all in the country… He is almost omnipotent. Not only the Iphwangseong Castle’s main castle, the Dochalwon, the Dongchang, and the Geumuiwi, but even the Five Military Commands and the Pojeongsa are giving their opinions on the suitability of Purple’s appointment. How could the life of a mere Dochalwon Jo-ma (record officer) be important in that matter? And you never know when that thug might strike.”


“ah…….”


The Imperial Inspectorate. The central inspection agency of the imperial family.


At this moment, the conversation between the inspector and the recorder could not be heard outside. It was not only the pouring rain that hid their presence.


The Dharma treasure of the temple with the power of hiding. The royal inspector was breathing internal energy into the scroll that was tied together.


Those who have sharpened their senses to the extreme must deliberately search their surroundings to detect just those two people.


The archivist sighed.




“Now that I think about it, this was poison. It wasn’t something to appease boredom… But I can’t pretend not to see the darkness right up close… … .”


“Look straight ahead. It’s our job to keep a close eye on their every move. Jihyun here isn’t doing any work at all. This is very serious.”


The inspector spoke coldly, looking at the road that circled between the village and Unhoebong Peak.


Sasa-sak


The silent movements characteristic of the Gyeongsin method. The small footsteps overlap without stopping.


It was on a huge scale.


Martial artists of all kinds were moving along the long mountain path.


At first glance, there seemed to be hundreds of them. It was difficult to find manners and etiquette among the loud voices.


“Everyone has gathered at the Wind Sword Gate.”


“Isn’t that guy the Iron Heart Slicer? I heard he learned a trick from Yeo-ryeong, so I wonder how strong he’s become… .”


“I heard that high-ranking officials also came to see the sights, so it would be best not to touch their escorts. It would be a headache.”


“Just rob the merchants.”


“Wait a minute, isn’t that the Ip Hwang Geum? It must have killed the White Warrior, but where on earth did it come from…?”


“The search is different, so don’t frame me! Let’s help quietly!”


They are chattering amongst themselves.


A swordsman with chains piercing through his long sword, a solitary swordsman praying alone, and dozens of people with exactly the same footwork as those who fly off walls as if they came from the same sect.


These truly extraordinary people kept passing by the eyes of the group of inspectors.


Geumsimun, Sipjeonmun, and Sunmaryeon.


In addition, there are the three following sects and other Sima Oedo warriors.


Rumor has it that even the martial artists who bowed their heads to Yeo-ryeong and Pae-geom-jong were entering Sacheon.




The archivist lowered his head slightly with a look of disgust on his face.


“Sima Weido, Jeong Sajigan, Ronin… Not only the thirteen thousand people in the mountains and rivers, but even those who want to get a piece of the action have all gathered here. I guess these are troubled times.”


“The moment the Baekdo Jeongpa gathered at Unhoebong comes down, they will sweep them away one by one. That is a great net. Since the thirteen heavenly places are directly leading the way, they must be seeing not only Ma Gwang-ik-ju but also Cheongseong and Ami’s elders as huge prey.”


“Surely, with that number of people, even a great Shaolin monk who has mastered the art of the reverse trajectory would be swept away by the crowd. At best, a dozen or so guards or imperial troops would have to come… … .”


“What are you talking about, an imperial army when it’s hard enough to deal with the northern tribes? The garrisons in each castle are limited to maintaining public order.”


The inspector said, looking at the end of the line.


“I hope Ji-hyeon here put the chimney in the Iphwangseong Fortress in time. No matter how mysterious the movements of the martial artists are, if the scale is that large, there should have been time to notice.”


“How many officials have not received bribes from the Yeo-ryeong bastards? If you simply ask them to turn a blind eye to the Gangho-sa, and they actually have a knife at their throat, there won’t be many who would refuse.”


“… … .”


“And with that level of force… wouldn’t it be difficult for two or three of the Seventeen Sects of the Shingeomdan to handle it? It would be fortunate if they weren’t completely wiped out.”


The archivist said. The inspector couldn’t answer right away.


As years of famine repeat, corrupt officials also increase. That is the way of the world.


The same goes for martial arts and martial arts. When the world is abundant, the righteous faction gains power.


The chivalry of providing the common people with food to eat right away can only be compared to the oily blade of Sima Weidao.


That is the reason why the Mu-maeks, who did not clearly distinguish between the Jeongsama and Jeongsama, began to bow their heads in large numbers to the Thirteen Heavens.

“… By the time they come back, my air power will have been completely depleted. I need to find a place to hide.”


The inspector said.


An unmanned, highly skilled officer with a high level of distribution. A rare official who possesses the Dharma treasure.


Either way, they were targets of exploitation. They had no fear of retaliation. It was a time when murder and extermination were common.


“The fields seem dangerous, so let’s stop by that village and rent a house. A bag of salt will easily cover ten days.”


The archivist said. The inspector sighed.


“Do you know when those Simawei guys will come barging in?”


“We have to deal with the Magwangikju and Gupa. The houses are still there, so there’s no reason to use force first. We can deal with those idiots who can’t even figure that out.”


“That’s true too.”


It was the moment when the two people were about to take a step.


“Munju! Come to your senses!”


A shout echoed from far behind. The energy wave was as strong as the group of Sima Wei that had just passed by.


The inspector and the recorder stopped in their tracks.


“Magwangikju is not here! You can open your eyes now!”


“Bonggong’s words are strange. Doesn’t it seem as if the panacea Moonju is afraid of Ma Gwang-ikju? If you were defeated once, you could just get revenge… … .”


“This is how you should do it to awaken the Great Law of the main text! Your blood energy must surge all the way to the Baihui point! I just came back from commanding my subordinates for a moment, and what a bolt from the blue! General! General!”


A chill ran down the archivist’s spine as he heard those words.


The Great Law of Turtle Breath.


A martial art that slows down your breathing and heartbeat, and even hides your true energy. It was not originally a martial art for killing people. It originated from wars between countries.


This was the way for defeated generals to survive. They could pretend to be dead by using a corpse as a blanket and practicing the ghost-eating method.




The ten-pronged swordsman Manbyeongje was defeated by Ma Gwangikju.


I survived by pretending to be dead.


“Munju! You can rest easy now! It’s not the scary Magwangikju, but the warriors of the text who are here! Munju is not a coward, is he? It’s not the Shihwamugeuksu of Magwangikju that I’m afraid of seeing even in my dreams, but the warm hands of Bonggong who are here!”


“Keuk… … !”


Soon, the sound of breathing being relieved rang out. The heavy inhalation and exhalation was clearly audible to the ears of the group of Dochalwon.


It was obvious whose breath it was.


“Ten Commandments…!”


It is the life force of the thirteen heavenly hosts.


Not only is one’s innate fortune different, but one’s innate energy is also different.


The pinnacle of Sima Oedo. After going through all kinds of chaos, he was bound to master the art of survival.


The archivist turned his head sharply toward the inspector.


“Isn’t this a big problem?! If the ten-man army that broke away from Unhoebong were to command the Sima Wei army that just passed by… …!”


“This is a big deal.”


The inspector replied briefly. He was now staring blankly over the archivist’s shoulder.


“Are you hearing correctly? What I mean is….”


“The world has come together. The pillars that supported the order of this country.”


“yes?”


“My classmates said that the leader of the Shingeomdan group committed treason… … .”


Kugu-kung!


A wind that suddenly blew.




It was a fleeting moment. It felt like it had descended from the distant sky, and it passed over the archivist’s head with a strangely heavy feeling.


As if a dozen or so massive typhoons were coming at once.


The archivist is from a particularly prestigious family in Beijing. He learned the secret method of the Taoist temple from a young age.


When I raised my head, I saw several black streaks of comet tails.


Very far away. Figures leaping between mountain ranges, using clouds as a springboard like the Great Heavenly Fortress.


It was such a distant place that it seemed so small, but it seemed like we would arrive there soon.


“It’s dangerous.”


The inspector muttered.


“yes?”


“That peak can’t be a battlefield for martial artists. Whether it’s the Magwangikju or the elders of the old faction, someone has to come down. The common people who climbed Misan will be swept away.”


The inspector continued speaking slowly. It was like a soliloquy.


“But who would throw themselves into the world of heaven and earth with only three peerless masters?”


That was when.


The middle of the village they had been looking at earlier.


Spot! Jeee …


Suddenly, two figures appeared distorted. It was in the middle of an empty lot surrounded by houses. In an instant, hundreds of rays of light flickered between the two figures.


Each and every ray of light released contained such enormous power that even the energy that should have been released outward was compressed into a gust of wind and thrust into the opponent, causing a loud thumping noise that shook the ground.


A village that was as quiet as a mouse.


A little boy who had sneaked out opened his mouth while playing on a swing, and a young man with long ears and the appearance of a Taoist priest clenched his teeth and turned his back on the boy.


Yangbyeokgeomgun Cheongsu Jinin.




He was the head of the Cheongseongpa faction. While chasing after Sunmaryeonju, he confirmed the approach of Geumsimunju. It was a private house. He had no choice but to come down.


“Geumsimunju! Let’s move!”


The short woman tilted her head slightly to the side, as if asking why.


“Get out of the way. There is a Dharma treasure buried behind you.”


A beautiful voice flowed from her lips. Words and actions that treated the new leader of the Cheongseongpa as a child.


Saaaaa―


The black hair that had fallen just enough to cover the back of his neck slowly flowed even in the midst of the swordsmanship of the Cheongsu Jinin.


The jade bottle held in one hand gave off a sweet fragrance as it was hit by the sword wind.


Only the blurred right hand is moving.


Her slender shoulders moved leisurely as if they were following the beat of the music. The movements were transcendent. The superiority was clear.


The Qingshui Jinren, who had even been protecting the child behind his back, quickly revealed his collapse.


His blue and red sword strike trajectories rippled violently once, then scattered in all directions with a loud cracking sound.


Hwaaaa …


It was when Cheongsu Jinin hesitated and started spitting out blood.


Geumsimunju pressed the edge of his hand against his temples and then tilted his waist to the side, as if a village girl had seen something strange over the side of an adult’s waist.


She licked her lips.


“hi.”


“… … .”


“It’s at the peak. I was on my way up.”


Geumsimunju slowly lowered her arms. Her long orange sleeves brushed the ground.




Damn it.


A young man of peerless beauty was walking forward, holding a divine sword that shone in the sunlight.


The hem of the pitch-black garment silently brushed against the swing guarded by the Pure Water Jinin, and from that moment on, the atmosphere began to become tense.


The space distorted like a rainbow was clearly visible to the naked eye.


“Oh… … ?”


The child who had fallen behind the swing gently floated back and away. This was because a strong breeze was emanating from the young man’s body.


Among the villagers who had fled, those who remained were terrified and began to run, carrying their children.


wickedness-


Jeongyeonshin swung her divine sword Yeorei long once.


“I saw the rain well. What’s next? A three-peat?”


Geumsimunju asks with a blank expression.


It was a strange tone. It seemed as if they were engaged in some kind of game. Wasn’t it always like this when offering offerings in the form of a dragon?


“Kill.”


Jeongyeonshin said quietly.
